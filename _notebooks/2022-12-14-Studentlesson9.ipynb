    "### Halting Problem Example:\n",
    "- In order to understand this, suppose that an algorithm was able to analyze whether a code halts or not. Let's call this algorithm `HaltChecker`.\n",
    "- `HaltChecker` analyzes the program,`program P`, and its input,`input I`. If `program P` halts with `input I`, `HaltChecker` returns an output of \"halts\". If `program P` doesn't halt(runs forever) with `input I`, `HaltChecker` returns an output of \"never\". For example, in the code where it tests if variable **number**, the <u>code runs forever</u>, so `HaltChecker` returns an output of <u>\"never\"</u>.\n",
    "- Then, we add another algorithm called `Reverser` which reverses `HaltChecker`'s output. So, if \"never\" is the output of `HaltChecker`, then the output of `Reverser` is <u>\"halts\"</u>. It's also the same the other way around: if `HaltChecker` has an output of \"halts\", then `Reverser` has an output of <u>\"never</u>.\n",
    "- We combine these algorithms into one entire body of code.\n",
    "- **Since `Reverser` is the algorithm at the end, hence giving the ultimate output, notice how it prints \"never\" when in fact there is an end(As proved by `HaltChecker`), and how it also prints \"halts\" when there is in fact is no end to the code(Also proved by `HaltChecker`). As a result, `HaltChecker` is inaccurate and this is an undecidable problem.**\n",

    "## Hacks\n",
    "Come up with one situation in which a computer runs into an undecidable problem. Explain why it is considered an undecidable problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "One situation in which a computer may run into an undecidable problem is when it is trying to determine whether a given mathematical statement is true or false. This problem, known as the axiomatic truth problem, is considered undecidable because there is no algorithm that can accurately determine the truth value of an arbitrary mathematical statement. The reason the axiomatic truth problem is undecidable is that it involves trying to determine the truth or falsity of an arbitrary statement, which may be impossible to do with complete accuracy. In mathematics, a statement is considered true if it can be proven to be true using a set of axioms and rules of inference. However, it is not always possible to prove the truth or falsity of a given statement using these methods. For example, the statement \"There are infinitely many prime numbers\" cannot be proven or disproven using the standard axioms of mathematics."
