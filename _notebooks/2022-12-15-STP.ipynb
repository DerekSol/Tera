    "## Calling Procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "Slide 1:\n",
    "- A procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values.\n",
    "- Procedures are referred to by different names, such as method or function, depending on the programing language.\n",
    "- Parameters are input values of a procedure. Arguments specify the values of the parameters when procedure is called.\n",
    "- A procedure call interrupts the sequential execution of statements causing the program to execute the statements within the procedure before continuing. One the last statement in the procedure (or a return statement) has executed, flow or control is returned to the point immediately following where the procedure was called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slide 2:\n",
    "- When calling procedures, it's important to take notice to whether it returns data, or a block of statements.\n",
    "- If the procedure just returns a block of statements, you call the procedure by referring to the procedure name, and inputting the arguments.\n",
    "- If the procedure returns some sort of data like a boolean or value, then you will assign that value to a variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Slide 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assume the Temperature outside is Fahrenheit. \n",
    "- The procedure convertFahrenheit is intended to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius.\n",
    "- Convert the following psuedocode to python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Developing Procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "Slide 8: \n",
    "\n",
    "Picking a descriptive name is important in case you revisit the code later on (separate words with capitals)\n",
    "There are 2 different types of procedures- ones that return a value and those that simply execute a block of statements\n",
    "Steps of developing procedure: picking a useful name, thinking of parameters (what data does the procedure need to know), making a flowchart or writing procedure in pseudocode, and actually developing the procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slide 9: \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, a teacher is writing a program that will replace the grade on a previous quiz if the new grade is better than the previous.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What would be a good name for this procedure?\n",
    "- What parameters do we need for this procedure?\n",
    "- Try writing this procedure out in python based on the given pseudocode\n",
    "\n",
    "## Procedural Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "- One type of abstraction is procedural abstraction which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be used only knowing what it does and not how it does it\n",
    "- This is very helpful in managing complexity in a program\n",
    "- Subdivision of a program into separate subprograms is called modularity\n",
    "- A procedural abstraction may extract shared features to generalize functionality instead of duplicating code. This allows for program reuse, which helps manage complexity\n",
    "- When a pre-written procedure is called, you don’t necessarily need to know the details of this, just what it does and how to call it\n",
    "- Simply, procedural abstraction is naming and calling a pre-written procedure\n",
    "- Making sure to include the right arguments so the procedure can do what its supposed to do is crucial"

    "In terms of coding, NBA 2K is a simulation because it uses a computer program to simulate the behavior and interactions of the various elements that make up a game of basketball. This includes the players, the ball, the court, and the rules of the game. To create this simulation, the developers of NBA 2K use a combination of algorithms, data structures, and mathematical calculations to model the behavior of these elements. For example, they may use algorithms to simulate the movement of the ball and the players on the court, and use data structures to store information about the teams, players, and game rules. Additionally, the developers may use mathematical calculations to model the physics of the game, such as the effects of gravity on the ball and the players, and the interactions between different objects on the court.
