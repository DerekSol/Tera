**Tonight’s Reading Notes: Liberal & Conservatives**

DQ: What are some examples in which libertarians would like the government to take minimal take action?

*<span class="underline">The Ideas that Divide Us</span>*

  - > Most Americans are united through key values (democracy, freedom, and equality)

  - > We are dramatically different; regilionm education geographically, and backgrounds

  - > This creates different opinions politically and can divide us

Ideologies - different belief systems

  - > Our ideologies depend on the arguments we make to back them up

  - > Our debate is narrow in the U.S. compared to other countries

  - > No communist or socialist parties in the U.S.

  - > Two main ideological camps, liberals(Democratic Party) and conservatives(Republicans)

  - > Conservatives form a political opinon from traditional social values, distrust of government action, resistance to change, and social order

  - > Liberals form a political opinon from potential for progress and change, trust in government, innovations to answer societies problems, and expansion of individual rights/expression

*<span class="underline">The Economic Dimension</span>*

  - > Since FDR and Great Depression, conservatives and liberals differ on how much they should trust the government

  - > Conservatives = not trust gov with too much power

  - > Liberals = willing to trust gov more to regulate economy

  - > Conservatives = right

  - > Liberals = left

*<span class="underline">The Social Order Dimension</span>*

  - > People divided on how much of the government’s role should partake in controlling their lives

  - > Conservatives view of social order = emphasize religion in public life, no abortion/suicide, promote traditional family values(no gay marriage/rights), “American Way”(no diversity/restricting immigration), people should know their place in society, block anything that promotes the opposite of this

  - > Liberals view of social order = preserve environment, community of equality/protect minorites, individual safety(gun control laws)

*<span class="underline">The Relationship Between the Two Ideological Dimensions</span>*

Economic liberals - willing to let government make decisions about the economy and like individualistic positions in social order

  - > Affirmative action

  - > Prefer individuals to have full freedom on noneconomic terms

  - > Value diversity/expanding rights to those who were left out

Economic conservatives - dont want government to interfere with peoples private lives and that gov should limit their role in economy too

  - > Lessen role of decision making to relugate the market

  - > Eliminate unfair trade practices

  - > Provision of some public goods

  - > Open policies to immigrants

Libertarians - extreme holders of economic conservative views, believe that only minimal government action is necessary

Social liberals - like some government role to achieve more equal distribution of material resources and want some role in social order too

  - > Like freedom to make individual moral choices

  - > Want government action for diverse and equal power structure and regulate to better health and safety

Communitarians - extreme of social liberalisms, strong commitment to community by equality of all people

Social conservatives - want limited government involvement economically but less forcefully than conservatives

  - > Concern of moral life

  - > Emphasize funadmentalist religious values and traditional family roles(gov control of reproductive choices)

  - > Reject change or diversity

  - > Immigration is a threat, dilutes social order

  - > Protect moral character, like a community thatemphasizes hierarchical order over equality

  - > Like a large/powerful state

Class Discussion:

Ideologies - set of beliefs about politics and society that help us make sense of the world(parents most influence this)

U.S - 2 primary ideological camps

![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/2022-08-28-Reading-Notes-for-AP-Gov---Derek-Sol/media/image1.png)

  - > Most Americans are somewhere in the middle of the political spectrum and are not extreme in their views(called moderates)

  - > **Republican and Democrat are NOT ideologies, they are parties…it’s different\!**

  - > Many conservative and liberal political parties. R’s/D’s are just the two biggest ones in US poltiics

Liberals - Democrats, Green Party

Conservatives Republicans, Reform Party

Libertarians - conservative, consistent about little government intervention

1930’s Key time period - Great Depression

\-New ideas on government intervention(more of it) - more liberal

Polarization

\-means being farther apart in views

\-L and C are MORE polarized in recent years

Why? Lots of theories: media, social media, weak parties, a primary system with low voter turnout(mostly those more extreme), little incentive for one party to “help” the other party govern after an election

\-Polarization makes compromise harder
