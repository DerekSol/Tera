# Notes on my Section of teaching
### 3.6: Daily Video 1 Notes
- Learning how to express an algorithm that uses selection without using a programming language, such as flowcharts and pseudo code
- Selection determines which part of an algorithm are executed based on a condition being true or false
- Algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task
- Consists of combinations of sequencing, selection, and iteration
- Selection allows us to choose different outcomes based off of the result of a decision or condition
- Can write an algorithm to update a high score for example
- 1.Set highScore to 10
- 2.Get currentScore from user
- Using selection, 3. If currentScore is greater than highScore, set highScore to currentScore
- 4.If not, Display highScore

### 3.6: Daily Video 2 Notes
- Learn how to write conditional statements
- Conditional statements, also known as “if-statements,” affect the sequential flow of control by executing different statements based on the value of a Boolean expression
- Can write them as if blocks or if else blocks
- If condition is true, whatever statement is in the block of statements is done
- IF ELSE, two outcomes, IF is just one particular outcome
- First get input from the user, IF statement will take the Boolean expression and put it in the parentheses or the block associated for the IF
- IF it is true, displays the number
- Display goodbye outside of if statement so it says goodbye whether or not the outcome of IF is true or else
- Represent these algorithms that have selection by writing conditional statements, these allow us to alter the outcome based off of a Boolean expression, can do IF ELSE statements to have two different outcomes 

### 3.6: Daily Video 3 Notes
- Learn how to determine the result of conditional statements
- Conditional statements alter the flow of execution in our program, can do this using IF blocks, or we can do IF ELSE blocks to choose from two different outcomes
- ELSE only executes if the IF condition is false
- IF statements allow us to perform specific action based off the condition being true or false
