# Notes on my Section of Teaching
### 3.6: Daily Video 1 Notes
- Learning how to express an algorithm that uses selection without using a programming language, such as flowcharts and pseudo code
- <mark>Selection determines which part of an algorithm are executed based on a condition being true or false</mark>
- <mark>Algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task</mark>
- Consists of combinations of sequencing, selection, and iteration
- <mark>Selection allows us to choose different outcomes based off of the result of a decision or condition</mark>
- Can write an algorithm to update a high score for example
- 1.Set highScore to 10
- 2.Get currentScore from user
- Using selection, 3. If currentScore is greater than highScore, set highScore to currentScore
- 4.If not, Display highScore

### 3.6: Daily Video 2 Notes
- Learn how to write conditional statements
- <mark>Conditional statements, also known as “if-statements,” affect the sequential flow of control by executing different statements based on the value of a Boolean expression</mark>
- Can write them as if blocks or if else blocks
- If condition is true, whatever statement is in the block of statements is done
- <mark>IF ELSE, two outcomes, IF is just one particular outcome</mark>
- First get input from the user, IF statement will take the Boolean expression and put it in the parentheses or the block associated for the IF
- IF it is true, displays the number
- Display goodbye outside of if statement so it says goodbye whether or not the outcome of IF is true or else
- <mark>Represent these algorithms that have selection by writing conditional statements, these allow us to alter the outcome based off of a Boolean expression, can do IF ELSE statements to have two different outcomes</mark> 

### 3.6: Daily Video 3 Notes
- Learn how to determine the result of conditional statements
- Conditional statements alter the flow of execution in our program, can do this using IF blocks, or we can do IF ELSE blocks to choose from two different outcomes
- <mark>ELSE only executes if the IF condition is false</mark>
- IF statements allow us to perform specific action based off the condition being true or false

# Lesson Plan Idea
- <mark>PearDeck</mark> encapsulating 3.5-3.7
- Each one of us is responsible for teaching a section, since there is only three sections, two of us will work together to teach the same section
- Ethan and I will be responsible for teaching 3.6, which is <mark>Conditionals</mark>
- On the PearDeck, there will be visuals on slides to support our teaching, and is a more interactive form of a presentation to keep them engaged
- We will put flow charts and images of code relating to conditionals, like IF blocks and IF ELSE blocks, and definitions of what algorithms and selection means
- Plan to teach for about <mark>10 minutes</mark> on this section
- Afterward, have them go through <mark>3 questions</mark> relating to this conditionals section, thinking one question could be putting a specific example of an IF statement and having them determine the outcome.
- Maybe question where you are given a scenario and have to show me how you would build this conditional statement on VSCode.
- First person to get these questions right can be rewarded with candy
- At the end, we could give them independent work time to create an IF statement and and IF ELSE statement in VSCode as <mark>homework<mark>.
