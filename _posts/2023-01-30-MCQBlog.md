When looking back at this question, I realized that Algorithm A does indeed calculate the correct average as well. For some reason I thought that for Algorithm A, the person in step two was a continuation for step 3, but those are two separate people. Therefore, I thought that Algorithm A wouldn't calculate the average because of that. But because Step 2 and 3 are two different people, it makes sense that it would calculate the correct average as well.
