We have all experienced Crowdsourcing by using external data through APIâ€™s, namely RapidAPI. This data has influenced how we code and shown possibilities in obtaining and analyzing data. Discuss APIs you have used.
- I used a BasketballAPI for my last project with a bunch of data about basketball players
- Some other people used an API that gives you words for hangman
- Another person used an NBA API that gave random NBA players with their stats


We have all participated in code Crowdsourcing by using GitHub. Many of you have forked from the Teacher repository, or exchanged code with fellow students. Not only can we analyze GitHub code, but we can obtain profiles and history about the persons coding history. What is the biggest discovery you have found in GitHub?
- The biggest discovery that I found in Github is that I am able to clone repositories and work on the same repository as a group. I also was blown away with the way I can create issues and use that as a form of submitting weekly checks


Kaggle datasets for code and science exploration. The avenue of data points us youtube or netflix channels. Analyzing crowd data helps us make decisions. Exam top 10 to 20. Did you see anything interesting?
- I noticed that all the trending sets are very unique and different from one another, however some of them do connect in ways. For example there is a good amount pertaining to social media like Youtube, bots of Social Media, ChatGPT Reddit, etc
