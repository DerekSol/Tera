1. When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog.

The type of license that Github offers when I looked at my repository was the Apache License 2.0. I researched what type of license it was and found that it is a type of open source, permissive software license. It says it allows commercial and private use, but their is trade mark use limitations. I think mine is an Open Source GPL License because this means the Github project must be public, which it is.

2. In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic.
Digital Right, 

3. Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update.
