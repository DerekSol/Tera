1. When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog.

The type of license that Github offers when I looked at my repository was the Apache License 2.0. I researched what type of license it was and found that it is a type of open source, permissive software license. It says it allows commercial and private use, but their is trade mark use limitations. I think mine is an Open Source GPL License because this means the Github project must be public, which it is.

2. In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic.

Digital Rights is where the companies where companies protect the content that they produce so that other people don't just steal it and sell it for free because usually we pay for these services. Things I can think about for this in terms of Music will be like Spotify. You can still use it without a membership, but it is a whole lot better with it because you can listen to all the songs that you want when you want. However I have seen other apps mimic spotify and even copy their name with the same concept, except give the exclusive membership benefits for free. To me, it is crazy that people can still find ways to download the stuff for free and bypass all the protection companies put on their content.

3. Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update.

I have changed my github personal blog license from the standard Apache License 2.0 to the MIT License. I picked this as my license because it allows for a friendly blog repo that allows me to let others use code freely and make and distribute closed source versions. However, I would appreciate my credit if used. I plan to do the same for our team repo, but I would like to talk it over with my groups members before doing so.
