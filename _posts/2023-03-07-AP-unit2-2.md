<h2 id="Enumerate-&quot;Data&quot;-Big-Idea-from-College-Board">Enumerate "Data" Big Idea from College Board<a class="anchor-link" href="#Enumerate-&quot;Data&quot;-Big-Idea-from-College-Board"> </a></h2><blockquote><p>Some of the big ideas and vocab that you observe, talk about it with a partner ...</p>
<ul>
<li>"Data compression is the reduction of the number of bits needed to represent data"</li>
<li>"Data compression is used to save transmission time and storage space."</li>
<li>"lossy data can reduce data but the original data is not recovered"</li>
<li>"lossless data lets you restore and recover"</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>My takeaway:Lossy data is useful in terms of recovering data. Data compression is like methods that can be done to make images smaller and more compressed.</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://csp.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/starter/rgb/">Image Lab Project</a> contains a plethora of College Board Unit 2 data concepts. Working with Images provides many opportunities for compression and analyzing size.</p>

<p>Describe some of the meta data and considerations when managing Image files.  Describe how these relate to Data Compression ...</p>
<p><strong>My takeaway: These relate to data compression because when we resize an image based on its pixels, putting an image from 2048x1020 to 320x240 would be compressing the image into a smaller size on the screen, showing data compression.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>File Type, PNG and JPG are two types used in this lab</li>
<li>Size, height and width, number of pixels</li>
<li>Visual perception, lossy compression</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ls and cd are the main ones I use to access my files.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What are the command you use in Windows terminal to access files?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I am on Mac, but if I was on Windows I would use wsl.</strong></p>
<p>What are some of the major differences?</p>
<p><strong>Even though they are both command line interfaces allowing users to interact with computer based commands, the major differences between terminal and Windows terminal is that Windows terminal gives more features and is more of an advanced user interface.</strong></p>
<p>Provide what you observed, struggled with, or leaned while playing with this code.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is path a big deal when working with images?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>path is a big deal with working with images, because path is the directory which will pull where the images come from. So simply if there is no path to get the images, the images won't be able to connect and pop up on your website.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>How does the meta data source and label relate to Unit 5 topics?
<strong>Meta data is data that provides information about other data, in Unit 5 and this class, we are in Data Structures 1. Everything that we are learning is pretty much relating to data, therefore all of our class will relate</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Look up IPython, describe why this is interesting in Jupyter Notebooks for both Pandas and Images?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IPython is an enhanced interactive Python shell that provides a more convenient and productive environment for interactive and exploratory computing. IPython can be used as a standalone application or as a kernel for Jupyter notebooks, which is a web-based interactive computational environment for creating and sharing documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If it is a bigger picture, it takes up more space meaning that it will take more time to load, whereas a smaller picture would render much faster. This is similar to lagging in the sense that it is taking a longer time to process.</strong></p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Yes, its getting the images through the path, defining them, and formatting them to display as an output.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Describe Grey Scale algorithm in English or Pseudo code?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Grey scale algorithm is converting an image from color to grey scale. The algorithm works by calculating the average value of the color channels for each pixel in the image and replacing the color value of that pixel with the calculated grey scale value.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Describe scale image?  What is before and after on pixels in three images?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scale image is resizing an image whether that means increasing or decreasing its size. Depending on making image bigger or smaller, each pixel in the original image will be duplicated or removed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Image 1(1000x1000), before scaling would be 1000 x 1000 pixels, after scaling could be 500 x 500 pixels, meaning each block of 4 pixels in the original image would produce 1 pixel in the scaled image.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is scale image a type of compression?  If so, line it up with College Board terms described?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scaling an image is not a compression because it does not involve removing any information from the image, it just changes it by duplicating or removing pixels. In College Board terms, scaling an image is considered a preprocessing step in image compression. Preprocessing is any steps taken to prepare the image data for compression.</strong></p>

<p><strong>CollegeBoard Practice Problems for 2.3</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111466901/224621134-b6fffb00-cebd-4328-bb91-a37f0b4a4972.png" alt="image"></p>
<ul>
<li><mark>Question 1</mark> was "Which of the following is an advantage of a lossless compression algorithm over a lossy compression algorithm?" I choose B which was correct, and it was "A lossless compression algorithm can guarantee reconstruction of original data, while a lossy compression algorithm cannot." This is the right answer because it is true that lossless can guarantee reconstruction of original data, but lossy compression can't.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><mark>Question 2</mark> was "A user wants to save a data file on an online storage site. The user wants to reduce the size of the file, if possible, and wants to be able to completely restore the file to its original version. Which of the following actions best supports the user’s needs?" I choose A which was correct, it said "Compressing the file using a lossless compression algorithm before uploading it." This is the correct answer since lossless compression allows reconstruction of the original data and reducing the size of the data.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><mark>Question 3</mark> was "A programmer is developing software for a social media platform. The programmer is planning to use compression when users send attachments to other users. Which of the following is a true statement about the use of compression?" I choose answer A which was wrong and I wasn't too sure about the answer, but it was my educational guess. I choose the one that said lossless compression video files will generally save more space than lossy compression of video files. But the correct answer is actually C, "Lossy compression of an image file generally provides a greater reduction in transmission time than lossless compression does." This is correct because although fewer bits may be stored, information is not necessarily lost when lossy compression is applied to an image.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Choose 2 images, one that will more likely result in lossy data compression and one that is more likely to result in lossless data compression. Explain.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lossy Data Compression</strong>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111466901/224612048-1f531238-709e-4b0b-8dbb-6242499e8e34.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>This is a lossy data compression because it usually is an image with very high detail, lots of graphics and color blends. This can result in reduced image quality taking away information not really noticeable to the human eye.</p>
<p><strong>Lossless Data Compression</strong>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111466901/224612149-44a5bbaf-4de1-48ec-84ba-7f96e7a92a1e.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>This is a lossless data compression because it is an image is simple graphics, and has large areas of solid color. This means it is a smaller file size and no loss of image quality.</p>
<blockquote><p>Project Addition</p>
<ul>
<li>If your project has images in it, try to implement an image change that has a purpose. (Ex. An item that has been sold out could become gray scale)</li>
</ul>
<p>Pick a programming paradigm and solve some of the following ...</p>
<ul>
<li>Numpy, manipulating pixels.  As opposed to Grey Scale treatment, pick a couple of other types like red scale, green scale, or blue scale.  We want you to be manipulating pixels in the image.</li>
<li>Binary and Hexadecimal reports.  Convert and produce pixels in binary and Hexadecimal and display.</li>
<li>Compression and Sizing of images.  Look for insights into compression Lossy and Lossless.  Look at PIL library and see if there are other things that can be done.</li>
<li>There are many effects you can do as well with PIL. Blur the image or write Meta Data on screen, aka Title, Author and Image size.</li>
</ul>
