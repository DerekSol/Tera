**Question 21.**

The answer I choose were options B and C, but the correct answer was options B and D. I realized that D was a better answer than C for justifying the steps of the entry because Sorting by year will sort the spreadsheet on column C from least to greatest. Filtering by year will remove any entries with unknown years. Filtering by photographer will remove any entries with unknown photographers. Since the order of the entries is not affected by the filters, the photograph with the lowest year value will be in the first row of the spreadsheet. This is exactly what the desired entry is asking for.

# Test Correction Reflection
Overall, I think I did really well compared to other tests. I worked well with my whole team to really understand and go over each question. I believe that I am starting to understand more and more about Computer Science. One thing I think I really struggle on though is having to select multiple answers in the question, as I find those questions to be more tricky and confusing for me. But overall I definitely see improvement from past tests.
