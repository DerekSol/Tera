**Question 6**
<img width="1437" alt="Screen Shot 2023-04-02 at 10 22 41 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111466901/229418410-f5910b3f-e2bf-43a7-b5aa-404d6f39b0df.png">
I wasn't to sure how packets were transmitted over the Internet so I took an educated guess. After going over the answer, I realized that each packet contains data to be transmitted, along with metadata containing information used for routing the data, so that is the right answer.


**Question 23**
<img width="1436" alt="Screen Shot 2023-04-02 at 10 23 14 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111466901/229418503-9afacc30-c111-4f9e-8e4b-d7a27ef15cca.png">
the example of where not searching for patterns is needed to produce useful information is a high school analyzing student grades to identify the students with the top ten highest grade point averages. This is because a single high schoolâ€™s list of student grades is not considered a large set of data. Furthermore, identifying 10 students with the highest grade point averages is not an example of finding patterns.



**Question 24**
<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2023-04-02 at 10 24 00 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111466901/229418604-31a0671c-6039-4df2-887e-9d7e744534ec.png">
The longest amount of time when scaling up is actually sorting data instead of searching data. I assumed that searching data was going to take the longest because it had the largest numbers at its starting point. However, sorting data is correct because of how it will scale plus it is sorting the data.


**Question 26**
<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2023-04-02 at 10 24 31 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111466901/229418682-e71d4c45-8e2e-4249-9d74-9e05c526b8c9.png">
The true statement about data compression is there are trade-offs involved in choosing a compression technique for storing and transmitting data. I wasn't sure what was true and took my best guess at it.



**Question 39**
<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2023-04-02 at 10 24 52 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111466901/229418726-24a0ce4a-bb6a-4efb-adba-abd58d046e89.png">
1 3 2 4 cannot be executed from this code segment because in the second iteration of the loop, i is equal to 2. So, RANDOM(1, i) returns either 1 or 2. So, the output 1 3 2 4 is not possible.


**Question 46**
<img width="1437" alt="Screen Shot 2023-04-02 at 10 25 19 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111466901/229418779-2890386a-df81-43c5-adaf-6014ad8b8701.png">
B is the correct code segment for drawing the figure instead of C because the code segment draws the three line segments shown in the figure. The first call to drawLine draws a line segment with endpoints (1, 5) and (6, 5). The second call to drawLine draws a line segment with endpoints (1, 5) and (6, 7). The third call to drawLine draws a line segment with endpoints (1, 5) and (6, 3).

**Question 48**
<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2023-04-02 at 10 25 41 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111466901/229418818-45f9fdf2-bc81-46c3-aa93-8bc0586e85a7.png">
The value of x is approximately equal to the value of y because the binary search algorithm starts at the middle of the list and repeatedly eliminates half of the elements until the desired value is found or all elements have been eliminated.

# Test Correction Reflection
Overall, I believe I am doing steady and well on the tests, and this is usually the score I average. There were a few questions that I was a little confused on because I didn't know certain vocabulary, but after looking at the explanations and correct answers I was able to figure out why that was the correct answer. For future tests, I would say to really understand any vocabulary or definitions given to me in class and in tech talks because they do appear frequently in the practice tests that are given.
