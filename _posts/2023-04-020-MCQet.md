# Test Corrections

## Question 1
<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2023-05-01 at 9 43 26 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111466901/235490067-2cb7d4dc-4c08-496d-9f09-153fc18928db.png">
The answer that I put was C, however the correct answer was actually B. B is the correct answer because the code segment assigns the initial value of first to temp, then assigns the initial value of second to first. The initial value of first, which has been stored in temp, is then assigned to second. Therefore, the initial values of first and second have been interchanged.

## Question 35

The answer I put was C, but the correct answer was D. D is the correct option because Creative Commons licenses can be used by creators of digital music to specify how the samples can be used by others. A no-rights-reserved license allows others to freely make use of the samples.

## Question 41
<img width="1438" alt="Screen Shot 2023-05-01 at 9 48 26 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111466901/235490819-187abc22-3968-4c21-935e-364b8fd44313.png">
The answer that I put was A but the correct answer is B. This is the correct option because this expression uses theMax procedure to replace the midterm score with the higher of the two scores. The selected value is then added to the final exam score and assigned to One word, adjusted Total.

## Question 43 
<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2023-05-01 at 9 48 46 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111466901/235490862-ab245dba-4eb9-4128-a166-1dce1421d2b1.png">
The answer that I put was B but the correct answer is A. A is the correct answer because the pattern in the table appears to indicate that there are n squared steps for a list containing n items. This number of steps is a polynomial and therefore the algorithm runs in reasonable time. 


## Question 48
<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2023-05-01 at 9 49 07 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111466901/235490918-ed443ca0-3ef1-493d-8f8b-dea9fea859d5.png">
The answer that I put was B but the correct answer was actually D. D is the correct answer because this option causes the experiment to be successful when RANDOM, open parenthesis 1 comma 100, close parenthesis produces a result from 1 to 7 5, or 75% of the time.

## Question 56
<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2023-05-01 at 9 49 41 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111466901/235491022-412309a0-abc6-4984-83f0-367dd9071a53.png">
The answer I put was B, however the correct answer is D. D is the correct answer because the value of count starts at 1 and increases by twos, so it counts odd integers. The loop iterates 10 times, adding each intermediate value of count each time. Therefore, the program displays the sum of the odd integers starting at 1 and ending at 19.

# Reflection
Overall, I believe that I am improving throughout the MCQs. Things that I think I need to work on is seeing like a code block or code segments and be able to figure out what is executed because of the program. The reason I think I struggle with this a lot is because I don't really understand the terms that is being used in the code segment and how that affects the program entirely. I believe that if I work on this a little more I will be able to earn higher scores on future MCQ's overall.
