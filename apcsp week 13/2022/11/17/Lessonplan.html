<ul>
  <li>Learning how to express an algorithm that uses selection without using a programming language, such as flowcharts and pseudo code</li>
  <li><mark>Selection determines which part of an algorithm are executed based on a condition being true or false</mark></li>
  <li><mark>Algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task</mark></li>
  <li>Consists of combinations of sequencing, selection, and iteration</li>
  <li><mark>Selection allows us to choose different outcomes based off of the result of a decision or condition</mark></li>
  <li>Can write an algorithm to update a high score for example</li>
  <li>1.Set highScore to 10</li>
  <li>2.Get currentScore from user</li>
  <li>Using selection, 3. If currentScore is greater than highScore, set highScore to currentScore</li>
  <li>4.If not, Display highScore</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Learn how to write conditional statements</li>
  <li><mark>Conditional statements, also known as “if-statements,” affect the sequential flow of control by executing different statements based on the value of a Boolean expression</mark></li>
  <li>Can write them as if blocks or if else blocks</li>
  <li>If condition is true, whatever statement is in the block of statements is done</li>
  <li><mark>IF ELSE, two outcomes, IF is just one particular outcome</mark></li>
  <li>First get input from the user, IF statement will take the Boolean expression and put it in the parentheses or the block associated for the IF</li>
  <li>IF it is true, displays the number</li>
  <li>Display goodbye outside of if statement so it says goodbye whether or not the outcome of IF is true or else</li>
  <li><mark>Represent these algorithms that have selection by writing conditional statements, these allow us to alter the outcome based off of a Boolean expression, can do IF ELSE statements to have two different outcomes</mark></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Learn how to determine the result of conditional statements</li>
  <li>Conditional statements alter the flow of execution in our program, can do this using IF blocks, or we can do IF ELSE blocks to choose from two different outcomes</li>
  <li><mark>ELSE only executes if the IF condition is false</mark></li>
  <li>IF statements allow us to perform specific action based off the condition being true or false</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
<mark>PearDeck</mark> encapsulating 3.5-3.7</li>
  <li>Each one of us is responsible for teaching a section, since there is only three sections, two of us will work together to teach the same section</li>
  <li>Ethan and I will be responsible for teaching 3.6, which is <mark>Conditionals</mark>
</li>
  <li>On the PearDeck, there will be visuals on slides to support our teaching, and is a more interactive form of a presentation to keep them engaged</li>
  <li>We will put flow charts and images of code relating to conditionals, like IF blocks and IF ELSE blocks, and definitions of what algorithms and selection means</li>
  <li>Plan to teach for about <mark>10 minutes</mark> on this section</li>
  <li>Afterward, have them go through <mark>3 questions</mark> relating to this conditionals section, thinking one question could be putting a specific example of an IF statement and having them determine the outcome</li>
  <li>Maybe question where you are given a scenario and have to show me how you would build this conditional statement on VSCode</li>
  <li>First person to get these questions right can be rewarded with candy</li>
  <li>At the end, we could give them independent work time to create an IF statement and and IF ELSE statement in VSCode as <mark>homework</mark>
</li>
</ul>
