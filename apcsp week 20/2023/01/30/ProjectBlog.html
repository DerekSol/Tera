<p>My portion of the project is going to be the search bar to find tips and tricks through articles and videos that help you along your fitness journey.
Its is going to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>have a search bar at top of the page</li>
  <li>have videos and articles embedded into the actual page</li>
  <li>allow users to search for certain articles or videos to help them with fitness

<a class="anchor" href="#outline-of-materials-required-for-collegeboard" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Outline of materials required for CollegeBoard</h1>
    <h2 id="row-1-program-purpose-and-function">
<a class="anchor" href="#row-1-program-purpose-and-function" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Row 1: Program Purpose and Function</h2>
  </li>
  <li>overall purpose of the program is so that users can find videos and articles that they want to watch or read so that they can receive guidance on their fitness journey</li>
  <li>The video will go over the functionality of the program, meaning how the search bar works and what happens when you click on videos or articles</li>
  <li>The input and output will be described in the video, so it will show the user inputting a certain article or video they want to watch, the output will provide user the list of articles or videos related to their search</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="row-2-abstraction">
<a class="anchor" href="#row-2-abstraction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Row 2: Abstraction</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Code will show how the data has been stored, I will show it in backend and I will obtain the data from an API</li>
  <li>I will also show the data in this same list being used as part of fulfilling the programs purpose, the videos in the data are needed for the user to search certain videos and articles and have that pop up for them</li>
  <li>The variable is the article and videos, and the data represents what articles and videos the users will be allowed to search from in the program</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="row-3-managing-complexity">
<a class="anchor" href="#row-3-managing-complexity" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Row 3: Managing Complexity</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I will include a code segment that shows a list being used to manage complexity in the program, not to sure on this part, need to analyze this a little more to figure out how to show this</li>
  <li>I will explain how the named, selected list manages complexity in the program code by explaining why the program code could not be written, or how it would be written differently, without using this list, which again I need to think about more on how to do this.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="row-4-procedural-abstraction">
<a class="anchor" href="#row-4-procedural-abstraction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Row 4: Procedural Abstraction</h2>
<ul>
  <li>code segment that shows a student-developed procedure with at least one parameter that has an effect
on the functionality of the procedure, this will be me searching up a key word, then having it hone in and a couple videos and articles related to that key word</li>
  <li>I will describe what the identified procedure does and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the program, so it will hone in on the videos in which the user can click on to read and watch more about fitness, in turn they can use to better themselves whether it be in the gym or in their diet goal</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="row-5-algorithm-implementation">
<a class="anchor" href="#row-5-algorithm-implementation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Row 5: Algorithm Implementation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I plan to use sequencing, selection, and iteration when creating this search bar feature</li>
  <li>I will try my best to explain it so that someone else can figure out how this algorithm works and recreate it</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="row-6-testing">
<a class="anchor" href="#row-6-testing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Row 6: Testing</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I will give the two calls, which is searching in the search bar, and clicking on a video or article</li>
  <li>The result of searching the search bar will give specific videos based on search</li>
  <li>the result of click on a video or article is that it will bring you to that article or video in which you can watch or read it on a different page</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="video-plan">
<a class="anchor" href="#video-plan" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Video Plan</h1>
<p>I my video, I plan to show the entirety of the search bar feature. I will show how if I search up a certain word like “legs,” it will show videos that relate to training legs in the gym. I plan to do that with a couple of searches, like ones that are related to dieting as well. When I search something in particular, I will display how it only shows videos and articles that pertain to that search. Then I will click on a couple of those article and videos to show what they entail and really show the entirety of the search feature by doing so.</p>
