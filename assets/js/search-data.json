            "content": "Idea on Project . An idea I had for this project is somehow creating a website with a whole bunch of movies and TV shows that you can choose from, and a way to search for all of them. The technical requirements for this project include: . Final program code (created independently or collaboratively) | A video that displays the running of your program and demonstrates functionality you developed (created independently) | Written responses to all the prompts in the performance task (created independently) | . I feel like the things I can design now are probably the dropdown menu to choose from all these movies, and the code for when they click on the movie, for it to take them to a different screen to watch it. It also says &quot;students need practice implementing programs that first include sequencing, then incorporate selection and iteration, and finally use procedures and lists.&quot; I feel that we&#39;ve touched most if not all of these basics over the first couple of weeks. Somethings I would still need to learn is how to put the actual movie or TV show on the site, so when they hit play, they are watching it on the site. Some resources that I have available is code.org to maybe help we work with building apps more and understanding the code, the people around me in this class, and past students that have already taken this class. . from IPython.display import Image Image(filename=&quot;/Users/dmsol/Tera/images/Screen Shot 2022-09-11 at 12.29.24 PM.png&quot;, width=600, height=400) .",

Open a terminal in vscode, run command: cd _notebooks, type &#39;wget&#39; and paste this link into said terminal and run it . | Take notes wherever you please, but you will be graded on participating . | . So, what is a simulation anyway? . A simulation is a tested scenario used for viewing results/outputs to prepare for them in real world situations . | These can be used for games like dice rolling, spinners, etc . | These can be used for practical things such as building structures, testing car crashes, and other things before engaging in them in the real world . | These simulations can have the option of obeying real world physics (Gravity, collision) or they can go against these norms since this is a fictitious scenario, and couldn&#39;t happen in real life . | . Big Question . Which of the following simulations could be the LEAST useful? . | A retailer trying to identify which products sold the most . | A restaurant determining the efficiency of robots | An insurance company studying the rain impact of cars | A sports bike company studying design changes to their new bike design | . If you guessed a bike company, you&#39;re wrong, because the retail simulation was the right answer. Simulating robots in food service, sudying rain impact on vehicles, and new bike design can contribute a lot more to society in comparison to seeing what products sell more than others. | . Next Big Question . If you were making a simulation for making a new train station, which of the following would be true about this simulation? . It could reveal potential problems/safety issues before construction starts | It cannot be used to test the train station in different weather | Simulation will add high costs to projects | Simulation is not needed because this train station already exists | . Potential Saftey was the right answer, because you need somewhere to test the safety and ethicness of what you&#39;re about to do before you start building it. Otherwise, let&#39;s just say you&#39;ll have a special plaque for FBI&#39;s Most Wanted | . Simulation 1: . Both programs below do the same thing. Given a height and a weight, they calculate how long it will take for a object to fall to the ground in a vacuum subjected to normal Earth levels of gravity. . However, the second one is a simulation. It calculates the distance the object has fallen every 0.1 seconds. This is useful for if you wanted a visual representation of a falling object, which pure math can&#39;t do as smoothly. . height = float(input(&quot;height in meters?&quot;)) weight = input(&quot;weight in pounds?&quot;) stuff = (2 * (height / 9.8))**(1/2) print(&quot;It will take&quot;, stuff,&quot;seconds for an object that weighs&quot;,weight,&quot;pounds&quot;,&quot;to fall &quot;,height,&quot;meters in a vacuum&quot;) . t = 0 g = 0 d = 0 false = True while false: t = t + 0.1 d = 9.8 / 2 * (t**2) if d &gt;= height: false = False #print(d) # if you want to print the distance every time it calculates it. Too long to output to a terminal, but this could be useful to display graphically. #print(t) print(t) print(d) . Simulation 2: . This simulation is made in order to simulate movement on a 2d plane vs a 3d plane. . | How it works: we have multiple variables, if statements and equations under a while command in order to randomy generate steps on a 2d plane. Once it reaches the set destination, it will say that the man made it home after x amount of steps. . | For the 3D plane, it takes a lot longer due to how big and open the 3d environment is, so there are more if statements in the 3d plane . | . (explain further) . import random x = 0 y = 0 nights = 0 turn = 0 stopped = 0 turns = [] while (nights &lt; 100): step = random.randrange(4) if step == 0: x = x+1 if step == 1: x = x-1 if step == 2: y = y+1 if step == 3: y = y-1 turn = turn + 1 if x == 0 and y == 0: nights = nights + 1 print(&quot;The Man Has Made It Home After &quot;, turn, &quot;Turns&quot;) turns.append(turn) turn = 0 if turn/1000 % 1000 == 0 and x + y != 0: print(&quot;(&quot;, x,y, &quot;)&quot;) if (turn &gt; 10000000): stopped = stopped + 1 turn = 0 x = 0 y = 0 nights = nights + 1 print(&quot;Caped&quot;) average = sum(turns) / len(turns) print(&quot;Avaerage&quot;, average, &quot;Ones that when&#39;t too long &quot;, stopped) . import random x = 0 y = 0 z = 0 nights = 0 turn = 0 stopped = 0 turns = [] while (nights &lt; 100): #rando movement step = random.randrange(6) if step == 0: x = x+1 if step == 1: x = x-1 if step == 2: y = y+1 if step == 3: y = y-1 if step == 4: z = z+1 if step == 5: z = z-1 #Turn counter turn = turn + 1 #Goal check if x == 0 and y == 0 and z == 0: nights = nights + 1 print(&quot;The Bird Has Made It Home After &quot;, turn, &quot;Turns&quot;) turns.append(turn) turn = 0 if turn/1000 % 1000 == 0 and x + y + z != 0: print(&quot;(&quot;, x,y, &quot;) &quot;,&quot;| &quot;, z) #Too long Stoper if (turn &gt; 10000000): stopped = stopped + 1 turn = 0 x = 0 y = 0 z = 0 nights = nights + 1 print(&quot;Caped&quot;) average = sum(turns) / len(turns) print(&quot;Avaerage&quot;, average,&quot;Ones that when&#39;t too long &quot;, stopped) . Simulations in the wild . Simulations are used extremely frequently in real life applications. One of the most common examples of simulations are video games. A games physics engine can accurately simulate objects colliding . Another example is Blender, the software used in 3d animations class, here at Del Norte. Blender is made up of many small simulations, but one big one it uses is simulating the way light bounces off of and interacts with objects. . HW !!! . Create a simulation. It can be anything, just has to simulate something. . Some ideas: . Two objects colliding | Gravity on other planets | . AND . Find an example of a simulation in a software/game you use, screenshot, and explain how it is a simulation .",

            "content": "8/18/22 . Forms of Government Notes: . Autocracy . One person has all the power . | Two main types: monarchy/dictatorship . | . Monarchy . king/queen rules the country . | King or queen is known as the monarch . | Come to power through family line, current kings/queens oldest child becomes next queen/king . | Olden times, Have final say over government . | Modern times, share power with other parts of government . | . Dictatorship . One leader with absolute control over the people . | Has control over things, like a constitution . | Parts of government do what the dictator wants . | . Democracy . Citizens hold power . | Two types of democracies: representative/direct . | . Representative democracy . The people elect leaders to represent them in government . | They do all the necessary things to keep the country running . | Citizens hold ultimate power, if they don’t like what their representatives do, they can vote new representatives . | . Direct democracy . No representative, people directly involved in governing the country . | Might be required to participate in lawmaking or judges . | Most modern countries too large for direct democracy to work . | . Oligarchy(oligarchy- rule by a few) . Small group of people hold all the power . | Only certain group has political rights . | Few people control the country . | Junta - small group of people (usually military officers) who rule a country after taking it by force . | Junta operates kind of like a dictatorship . | . Theocracy(theo = God) . Government that puts God or a divine being as the ultimate authority . | Religious law settles . | . 8/19/22 . Public Policy . The goals and programs our government creates and implements for society (to create order and take care of people) . | Complicated process - involves various stakes and “inputs” . | Inputs: voters, media, special interest groups(organization that are non-governmental), politicians . | . Role of Government . What should the government do? (National, state and local) . | National government - government of the U.S., federal government . | State government - governor, make a lot of rules/regulations for California, whether constitution does not discuss is left to the states . | Local government - mayor, city council, school board . | Answers varu. Ideas differ. . | We do agree on some basic things! . | . Limited government . | Rule of law . | Social contract . | Democracy . | . Tonight’s Reading Notes: Liberal &amp; Conservatives . DQ: What are some examples in which libertarians would like the government to take minimal take action? . The Ideas that Divide Us . Most Americans are united through key values (democracy, freedom, and equality) . | We are dramatically different; regilionm education geographically, and backgrounds . | This creates different opinions politically and can divide us . | . Ideologies - different belief systems . Our ideologies depend on the arguments we make to back them up . | Our debate is narrow in the U.S. compared to other countries . | No communist or socialist parties in the U.S. . | Two main ideological camps, liberals(Democratic Party) and conservatives(Republicans) . | Conservatives form a political opinon from traditional social values, distrust of government action, resistance to change, and social order . | Liberals form a political opinon from potential for progress and change, trust in government, innovations to answer societies problems, and expansion of individual rights/expression . | . The Economic Dimension . Since FDR and Great Depression, conservatives and liberals differ on how much they should trust the government . | Conservatives = not trust gov with too much power . | Liberals = willing to trust gov more to regulate economy . | Conservatives = right . | Liberals = left . | . The Social Order Dimension . People divided on how much of the government’s role should partake in controlling their lives . | Conservatives view of social order = emphasize religion in public life, no abortion/suicide, promote traditional family values(no gay marriage/rights), “American Way”(no diversity/restricting immigration), people should know their place in society, block anything that promotes the opposite of this . | Liberals view of social order = preserve environment, community of equality/protect minorites, individual safety(gun control laws) . | . The Relationship Between the Two Ideological Dimensions . Economic liberals - willing to let government make decisions about the economy and like individualistic positions in social order . Favor housing subsidies for the poor . | Taxing to support social programs . | Affirmative action . | Prefer individuals to have full freedom on noneconomic terms . | Value diversity/expanding rights to those who were left out . | . Economic conservatives - dont want government to interfere with peoples private lives and that gov should limit their role in economy too . Lessen role of decision making to relugate the market . | Eliminate unfair trade practices . | Provision of some public goods . | Open policies to immigrants . | . Libertarians - extreme holders of economic conservative views, believe that only minimal government action is necessary . Social liberals - like some government role to achieve more equal distribution of material resources and want some role in social order too . Like freedom to make individual moral choices . | Want government action for diverse and equal power structure and regulate to better health and safety . | . Communitarians - extreme of social liberalisms, strong commitment to community by equality of all people . Social conservatives - want limited government involvement economically but less forcefully than conservatives . Concern of moral life . | Emphasize funadmentalist religious values and traditional family roles(gov control of reproductive choices) . | Reject change or diversity . | Immigration is a threat, dilutes social order . | Protect moral character, like a community thatemphasizes hierarchical order over equality . | Like a large/powerful state . | . Class Discussion: . Ideologies - set of beliefs about politics and society that help us make sense of the world(parents most influence this) . U.S - 2 primary ideological camps . . Most Americans are somewhere in the middle of the political spectrum and are not extreme in their views(called moderates) . | Republican and Democrat are NOT ideologies, they are parties…it’s different! . | Many conservative and liberal political parties. R’s/D’s are just the two biggest ones in US poltiics . | . Liberals - Democrats, Green Party . Conservatives Republicans, Reform Party . Libertarians - conservative, consistent about little government intervention . 1930’s Key time period - Great Depression . -New ideas on government intervention(more of it) - more liberal . Polarization . -means being farther apart in views . -L and C are MORE polarized in recent years . Why? Lots of theories: media, social media, weak parties, a primary system with low voter turnout(mostly those more extreme), little incentive for one party to “help” the other party govern after an election . -Polarization makes compromise harder . . 8/23/22 Notes . -Vouchers . -Public education is paid for by taxpayer dollars, mostly by state taxes . -some fed gov money, but constitution says nothing about education, thats why states mainly pay for it . 8/23/22 . Media Lecture Notes . Types of Media . Print - it is hardcopy, like newspapers . Less readers of Print media . | Influential, don’t want to see newspapers die out . | More politically active . | MORE reporting . | Ex: NYT, LA Times, WAPO . | . Broadcast Media - news from the TV or radio . Where most people get there news . | Ex: ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, etc. . | Talk radio - radio host where people come on and you interview them, not scripted, very partisan . | Internet - changed media and a lot more people need it . | Mix of sites, a lot are inaccurate . | . How Media Works . Profit, most driven by this . | They get it from advertising . | Conglomerates . | Can watch two different news station and they could actually both be owned by Disney, so should look at a variety of stations . | Professional Code of Ethics - Truthful, accuracy, etc. . | Correct themselves . | Reliable sources . | . Source Types . “On-the-record” - can be quoted, nothing has to be hidden, can use name and everything . | “On background” - dont use my name, but you can quote me, you can also give some hint as to where I work . | “On deep background” - take away more information, source is more deeply hidden, no quote directy but paraphrase allowed, can’t name person or where they work . | “Off the record” - nothing can be used, no information can come out, basically research for the reporter . | . Roles of the Media . Gatekeeper - the media can control and determine what and how long something can become a national political issue, they determine whats important to us and whats not . | Watchdog - Responsible of keeping track what the government does that might be wrong (Ex: Watergate scandal) . | Score Keeper - candidate does something or says something that is not great or good, makes politicians more careful with what they do . | Agenda Setter - similar to gatekeeper, helping the public decide what is important, whether public think is important is what the government is going to address . | . 8/24/22 . Fake News . Intential false information published as a fact . | NOT satire . | NOT an unintentional mistake . | NOT true information that you disagree with . | NOT editorial . | . How to Tell If it’s Fake News . Look at the URL - .co, .lo, .com. . | Check the “About Us” section . | Is there an address, location, staff? . | Who is the author? Do they have some credibility, Reporter? . | Check news on a factcheck site, factcheck.org or snopes.com . | Avoid provocative headlines . | Are there ridiculous statements? . | Avoid headlines or stories that use ALL CAPS . | Clickbait = “X reasons why…” . | . How to tell if it’s fake news or satire . If it sounds like a joke . | . Conspiracy theories . Conspiracy sources published unverified information that relates to known conspiracies (Aliens, Illuminati, etc.) . | Psuedoscience is similar, punlishes unverified health and scientific claim . | . Confirmation Bias . Confirmation bias leads you to believe information just because you happen to agree with and discount the parts you don’t . | Just because you think i’ts true doesn’t make it true . | If your goal is to find the truth - you need to use critical thinking skills to evaluate the validity of information . | . 8/26/22 .

A library is a collection of precompiled codes that can be used later on in a program for some specific well-defined operations. | These precompiled codes can be referred to as modules. Each module contains bundles of code that can be used repeatedly in different programs. | A library may also contain documentation, configuration data, message templates, classes, and values, etc. | . Why are libraries important? . Using Libraries makes Python Programming simpler and convenient for the programmer. | One example would be through looping and iteration, as we don’t need to write the same code again and again for different programs. | Python libraries play a very vital role in fields of Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Visualization, etc. | . A few libraries that simplify coding processes: . Pillow allows you to work with images. | Tensor Flow helps with data automation and monitors performance. | Matplotlib allows you to make 2D graphs and plots. | .

Certain procedures may be used with strings and they vary from programming language to language Python examples . len() to find the length of a string . lower() to convert to lowercase . etc. Pseudocode examples . len() returns the length of a string . concat() returns a string made up of the concatenated strings ex. concat(&quot;string1&quot;, &quot;string2&quot;) would return string1string2 . substring() returns the characters from the string beginning at the at the first position to the last so an example of this would be substring (&quot;abcdefghijk&quot;, 2, 5) would print bcde (pseudocode starts at 1) .

Unit 3 Sections 8-10 . Notes . Lists: a sequence of variables . we can use lists to store multiple items into one variable | used to store collections of data | changeable, ordered, allow duplicates | . There is list, then four total collection data types in Python . Tuple: collection that is ordered, unchangeable, allows duplicates | Set: collection that is unordered, unchangeable, doesn&#39;t allow duplicates | Dictionary: collection that is ordered, changeable, doesn&#39;t allow duplicates | . More Terms . Index: a term used to sort data in order to reference to an element in a list (allows for duplicates) | Elements: the values in the list assigned to an index | . Methods . Method Definition Example . append() | adds element to the end of the list | fruits.append(&quot;watermelon&quot;) | . index() | returns the index of the first element with the specified value | fruits.index(&quot;apple&quot;) | . insert() | adds element at given position | fruits.insert(1, &quot;watermelon&quot;) | . remove() | removes the first item with the specified value | fruits.remove(&quot;strawberry&quot;) | . reverse() | reverses the list order | fruits.reverse() | . sort() | sorts the list | fruits.sort() | . count() | returns the amount of elements with the specified value | fruits.count(&quot;apple&quot;) | . copy() | returns a copy of the list | fruits.copy() | . clear() | removes the elements from the list | fruits.clear() | . Iteration . Iteration is the repetition of a process or utterance applied to the result or taken from a previous statement. | There&#39;s a lot of types of iteration though, what to use? How do we apply iteration to lists? | Some methods include using a &quot;for loop&quot;, using a &quot;for loop and range()&quot;, using a &quot;while loop&quot;, and using comprehension | here are 2 types of iteration: definite and indefinite. Definite iteration clarifies how many times the loop is going to run, while indefinite specifies a condition that must be met | . Else, elif, break . Else: when the condition does not meet, do statement() | Elif: when the condition does not meet, but meets another condition, do statement() | Break: stop the loop | . Homework . HW Iteration . words = [&quot;alfa&quot;, &quot;bravo&quot;, &quot;charlie&quot;, &quot;delta&quot;, &quot;echo&quot;, &quot;foxtrot&quot;, &quot;golf&quot;, &quot;hotel&quot;, &quot;india&quot;, &quot;juliett&quot;, &quot;kilo&quot;, &quot;lima&quot;, &quot;mike&quot;, &quot;november&quot;, &quot;oscar&quot;, &quot;papa&quot;, &quot;quebec&quot;, &quot;romeo&quot;, &quot;sierra&quot;, &quot;tango&quot;, &quot;uniform&quot;, &quot;victor&quot;, &quot;whiskey&quot;, &quot;xray&quot;, &quot;yankee&quot;, &quot;zulu&quot;] inp = input().lower() print(inp + &quot; -&gt;&quot;) for i in range(len(inp)): for j in range(len(words)): if inp[i] == words [j][0]: print(words[j]) . derek -&gt; delta echo romeo echo kilo .

Unit 3 Sections 9-11 . Notes . Algorithms . Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks | Algorithms that appear similar can yield different side effects or results. | Some conditional statements can be written as the same as Boolean expressions (VICE VERSA) | Different algorithms can be developed or use to solve the same problem. | . Conditionals vs. Boolean . The condition and instructions are what differ, that&#39;s where the magic happens. The condition is a boolean expression when an expression outputs either true or false. Boolean values are another type of data type in programming languages, and they can only ever hold true or false. . Selection vs. Iteration . Selection: . A process used in algorithms where a conditional if-statement leads to one of two outcomes | Outcome 1: if the conditional statement is true, something will happen | Outcome 2: if the conditional statement is false, something else will happen | . Iteration . A process used in algorithms that allows certain things to happen until a condition is satisfied | Once the condition is satisfied, then an outcome is produced | This can take the form of a for-loop, while-loop, and/or if-statement | . Takeaways . You can use code you&#39;ve previously wrote in order to make a project easier. | Breaking algorithms down into steps can make things easier and more simple. | . Homework . Flowchart . Link to flowchart . import random def RandomNumGen(x): RandomNumGenList = [] while x &gt; 0: RandomNumGenList.append(random.randint(1,20)) x -= 1 print(RandomNumGenList) return max(RandomNumGenList) RandomNumGen(3) . [1, 16, 18] . 18 . Unit 3 Sections 12-13 . Notes . Calling Procedures . Slide 1: . A procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. | Procedures are referred to by different names, such as method or function, depending on the programing language. | Parameters are input values of a procedure. Arguments specify the values of the parameters when procedure is called. | A procedure call interrupts the sequential execution of statements causing the program to execute the statements within the procedure before continuing. One the last statement in the procedure (or a return statement) has executed, flow or control is returned to the point immediately following where the procedure was called. | . Slide 2: . When calling procedures, it&#39;s important to take notice to whether it returns data, or a block of statements. | If the procedure just returns a block of statements, you call the procedure by referring to the procedure name, and inputting the arguments. | If the procedure returns some sort of data like a boolean or value, then you will assign that value to a variable | . Slide 3: . Assume the Temperature outside is Fahrenheit. | The procedure convertFahrenheit is intended to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius. | Convert the following psuedocode to python | . Developing Procedures . Slide 8: . Picking a descriptive name is important in case you revisit the code later on (separate words with capitals) There are 2 different types of procedures- ones that return a value and those that simply execute a block of statements Steps of developing procedure: picking a useful name, thinking of parameters (what data does the procedure need to know), making a flowchart or writing procedure in pseudocode, and actually developing the procedure. . Slide 9: . In this example, a teacher is writing a program that will replace the grade on a previous quiz if the new grade is better than the previous. . What would be a good name for this procedure? | What parameters do we need for this procedure? | Try writing this procedure out in python based on the given pseudocode | . Procedural Abstraction . One type of abstraction is procedural abstraction which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be used only knowing what it does and not how it does it | This is very helpful in managing complexity in a program | Subdivision of a program into separate subprograms is called modularity | A procedural abstraction may extract shared features to generalize functionality instead of duplicating code. This allows for program reuse, which helps manage complexity | When a pre-written procedure is called, you don’t necessarily need to know the details of this, just what it does and how to call it | Simply, procedural abstraction is naming and calling a pre-written procedure | Making sure to include the right arguments so the procedure can do what its supposed to do is crucial | .

Unit 3 Sections 9-11 . Notes . Algorithms . Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks | Algorithms that appear similar can yield different side effects or results. | Some conditional statements can be written as the same as Boolean expressions (VICE VERSA) | Different algorithms can be developed or use to solve the same problem. | . Conditionals vs. Boolean . The condition and instructions are what differ, that&#39;s where the magic happens. The condition is a boolean expression when an expression outputs either true or false. Boolean values are another type of data type in programming languages, and they can only ever hold true or false. . Selection vs. Iteration . Selection: . A process used in algorithms where a conditional if-statement leads to one of two outcomes | Outcome 1: if the conditional statement is true, something will happen | Outcome 2: if the conditional statement is false, something else will happen | . Iteration . A process used in algorithms that allows certain things to happen until a condition is satisfied | Once the condition is satisfied, then an outcome is produced | This can take the form of a for-loop, while-loop, and/or if-statement | . Takeaways . You can use code you&#39;ve previously wrote in order to make a project easier. | Breaking algorithms down into steps can make things easier and more simple. | . Homework . Unit 3 Sections 12-13 . Notes . Calling Procedures . Slide 1: . A procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. | Procedures are referred to by different names, such as method or function, depending on the programing language. | Parameters are input values of a procedure. Arguments specify the values of the parameters when procedure is called. | A procedure call interrupts the sequential execution of statements causing the program to execute the statements within the procedure before continuing. One the last statement in the procedure (or a return statement) has executed, flow or control is returned to the point immediately following where the procedure was called. | . Slide 2: . When calling procedures, it&#39;s important to take notice to whether it returns data, or a block of statements. | If the procedure just returns a block of statements, you call the procedure by referring to the procedure name, and inputting the arguments. | If the procedure returns some sort of data like a boolean or value, then you will assign that value to a variable | . Slide 3: . Assume the Temperature outside is Fahrenheit. | The procedure convertFahrenheit is intended to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius. | Convert the following psuedocode to python | . Developing Procedures . Slide 8: . Picking a descriptive name is important in case you revisit the code later on (separate words with capitals) There are 2 different types of procedures- ones that return a value and those that simply execute a block of statements Steps of developing procedure: picking a useful name, thinking of parameters (what data does the procedure need to know), making a flowchart or writing procedure in pseudocode, and actually developing the procedure. . Slide 9: . In this example, a teacher is writing a program that will replace the grade on a previous quiz if the new grade is better than the previous. . What would be a good name for this procedure? | What parameters do we need for this procedure? | Try writing this procedure out in python based on the given pseudocode | . Procedural Abstraction . One type of abstraction is procedural abstraction which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be used only knowing what it does and not how it does it | This is very helpful in managing complexity in a program | Subdivision of a program into separate subprograms is called modularity | A procedural abstraction may extract shared features to generalize functionality instead of duplicating code. This allows for program reuse, which helps manage complexity | When a pre-written procedure is called, you don’t necessarily need to know the details of this, just what it does and how to call it | Simply, procedural abstraction is naming and calling a prewritten procedure | Making sure to include the right arguments so the procedure can do what its supposed to do is crucial | .

Changing the order of the steps changes the overall outcome, since every time the value assigned to a variable is changed, it overrides the last value which was assigned to the same variable. That is why it is important to track the value of variables, especially in code where the value is constantly changing. . num1 = 2 num2 = 4 num3 = 6 num1 = num2 + num3 # num1 is now 4 + 6, which is 10 num2 = num1 + num3 # num2 is now (the new num1) 10 + 6, which is 16 # output: num1 = 10, num2 = 16, num3 = 6 .

Do&#39;s Don&#39;ts Why . highScore | highestScoreInTheGame | Keep it simple and easy to read, having variables that are too complicated can cause your code to become messy later on | . highScore | highscore | Differentiate the words in your variable with a capital letter. Makes things easier to read | . firstName | n | not specific enough/vague | . isRaining | is it raining | spaces are improper syntax | . phoneNumber | 555-number | dashes are improper syntax and numbers should be avoided in variable names | . Types of data Integer: A number | Text/string: A word | Boolean: Data that determines if something is true or false | . | . name = &quot;table1&quot; #string print(name, type(name)) number = 4 #integer print(number, type(number)) isAbsent = False print(isAbsent, type(isAbsent)) . table1 &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; 4 &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt; False &lt;class &#39;bool&#39;&gt; . A list of data can also be stored in variables. Why is that useful? . print/retrieve specific values in the list without creating a lot of variables | easily remove/add/change items into the list | . colors = [&quot;red&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;] print(colors[2]) . yellow . Assignments . The assignment operator allows a program to change the value represented by a variable | Used to assigning values to variables | . Operator Description Syntax Outcome when print(a) . = | Assign value of right side of expression to left side operand | a = b | b | . += | Add right side operand with left side operand and then assign to left operand | a += b | a + b | . -= | Subtract right operand from left operand and then assign to left operand: True if both operands are equal | a -= b | a - b | . *= | Multiply right operand with left operand and then assign to left operand | a *= b | a * b | . /= | Divide left operand with right operand and then assign to left operand | a /= b | a / b | . **= | Calculate exponent(raise power) value using operands and assign value to left operand | a **= b | a ^ b | . a = 1 b = 2 a = b print(a) . The value stored in a variable will be the most recent value assigned . a = 1 b = a a = 2 print(b) . 1 . Changing Values . currentScore = 10 highScore = currentScore currentScore = 7 print(highScore) . your turn! Here are 3 problems for you to solve . num1 = 5 num2 = 9 num1 = num2 print(num1) print(num2) . num1 = 15 num2 = 25 num3 = 42 num2 = num3 num3 = num1 num1 = num2 print(num1) print(num2) print(num3) . Which of these will show the sum? . num2 += num1 print(num1) print(num2) print(str(num1)+ str(num2)) print(num1 + num2) . Data Abstraction . Method used in coding to represent data in a useful form, by taking away aspects of data that aren&#39;t being used in the situation | Variables and lists are primary tools in data abstraction | Provides a separation between the abstract properties of a data type and the concrete details of its representation | . Lists &amp; Strings . List = ordered sequence of elements | Element = individual value in a list that is assigned to a unique index | Index = a way to reference the elements in a list or string using natural numbers; each element of a string is referenced by an index | String = ordered sequence of characters (Letters, numbers, special characters) . Note: index starts at 1 for AP Exam, must be whole numbers, cannot be negative, and goes up to the number of elements in the list We can represent a list or string using a variable . | . Example of a List - Colors . Index Element . 1 | Green | . 2 | Blue | . 3 | Purple | . 4 | Pink | . At Index 1, the element is green, at index 2, the element is blue, etc. | . Managing the Complexity of a Program through Data Abstraction . Data abstractions help manage complexity in programs by giving a collection of data a name without referencing the specific details of the representation | Developing a data abstraction to use in a program can result in a program that is easier to develop and maintain | . Using Lists as Data Abstractions . What are Lists? . Allow for data abstraction | Bundle variables together | Store multiple elements | Allows multiple related items to be treated as a single value | Give one name to a set of memory cells | Can keep adding elements to it as needed | Can store elements as a single variable by using a list | . 3 Types of List Operations . Assigning values to a list at certain indices | Creating an empty list and assigning it to a variable | Assigning a copy of one list to another list (setting one list equal to another list) | 1. Assigning values to a list at certain indices . colorsList=[&quot;pink&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;] print(colorsList) . [&#39;pink&#39;, &#39;yellow&#39;, &#39;green&#39;, &#39;blue&#39;, &#39;orange&#39;] . 2. Creating an empty list and assigning it to a variable . colorsList=[] # can be used if you want to create a list that can be filled with values later . 3. Assigning a copy of one list to another list (setting one list equal to another list) . # copy of the list is made; the list isn&#39;t sorted in place def Reverse(lst): # defining variable: lst new_lst = lst[::-1] return new_lst lst = [&quot;pink&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;purple&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;black&quot;] print(Reverse(lst)) # reverse 1st . [&#39;black&#39;, &#39;blue&#39;, &#39;orange&#39;, &#39;yellow&#39;, &#39;purple&#39;, &#39;green&#39;, &#39;pink&#39;] . What is Managing Complexity? . Improving code readability | Reducing the need for new variables as more data is collected | Can easily update data | Can easily convert data to different forms | . How do Lists Help Manage the Complexity of a Program? . Don’t need as many variables | Can easily change the number of variables | Can apply the same mathematical computation (through an algorithm) to all the elements in the list | . Data Abstraction Practice . Manage the complexity of the given code below using a list. Re-write the code segment in a less complex way, but with the same result. . color1=&quot;green&quot; color2=&quot;red&quot; color3=&quot;pink&quot; color4=&quot;purple&quot; color5=&quot;blue&quot; color6=&quot;brown&quot; print(color1) print(color2) print(color3) print(color4) print(color5) print(color6) . green red pink purple blue brown . Answer . colorList=[&quot;green&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;pink&quot;, &quot;purple&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;brown&quot;] print(str(colorList)) . [&#39;green&#39;, &#39;red&#39;, &#39;pink&#39;, &#39;purple&#39;, &#39;blue&#39;, &#39;brown&#39;] . AP Exam Use of Data Abstraction . With the properties of the AP Exam pseudocode, lists work differently from what we&#39;ve learned in python so far, here are the two major differences: . The index does not start at 0 but 1 | There is only one method of interchanging data between lists, and that is completely overwriting previous list data with the other list n&quot;, | . Homework . You will turn in a program that utilizes lists and variables as it&#39;s primary function, options could be a quiz, a sorter, database, or wherever your imagination brings you. You will be graded on how well you understood the concepts and if you used anything other than just the simplest parts . Quiz template, if you do use it, fix the issues, and add more to it than it&#39;s current barebones state. I would recommend using it to create something related to school. . quesCount = 0 # Use a dictionary for the questions quesList = [&quot;Question1&quot;, &quot;Question2&quot;, &quot;Question3&quot;, &quot;Question4&quot;] # Use a dictionary for the correct solutions soluList = [&quot;Solution1&quot;, &quot;Solution2&quot;, &quot;Solution3&quot;, &quot;Solution4&quot;] quesAmount= len(quesList) hrm quesCount &lt;= quesAmount: print(quesList[quescount] + &quot; n&quot;) guess = input() if(guess == soluList[quesamOOuaunt]): score+=1 print(&quot;Correct!

Learning how to express an algorithm that uses selection without using a programming language, such as flowcharts and pseudo code | Selection determines which part of an algorithm are executed based on a condition being true or false | Algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task | Consists of combinations of sequencing, selection, and iteration | Selection allows us to choose different outcomes based off of the result of a decision or condition | Can write an algorithm to update a high score for example | 1.Set highScore to 10 | 2.Get currentScore from user | Using selection, 3. If currentScore is greater than highScore, set highScore to currentScore | 4.If not, Display highScore | . 3.6: Daily Video 2 Notes . Learn how to write conditional statements | Conditional statements, also known as “if-statements,” affect the sequential flow of control by executing different statements based on the value of a Boolean expression | Can write them as if blocks or if else blocks | If condition is true, whatever statement is in the block of statements is done | IF ELSE, two outcomes, IF is just one particular outcome | First get input from the user, IF statement will take the Boolean expression and put it in the parentheses or the block associated for the IF | IF it is true, displays the number | Display goodbye outside of if statement so it says goodbye whether or not the outcome of IF is true or else | Represent these algorithms that have selection by writing conditional statements, these allow us to alter the outcome based off of a Boolean expression, can do IF ELSE statements to have two different outcomes | . 3.6: Daily Video 3 Notes . Learn how to determine the result of conditional statements | Conditional statements alter the flow of execution in our program, can do this using IF blocks, or we can do IF ELSE blocks to choose from two different outcomes | ELSE only executes if the IF condition is false | IF statements allow us to perform specific action based off the condition being true or false | . Lesson Plan Idea . PearDeck encapsulating 3.5-3.7 | Each one of us is responsible for teaching a section, since there is only three sections, two of us will work together to teach the same section | Ethan and I will be responsible for teaching 3.6, which is Conditionals | On the PearDeck, there will be visuals on slides to support our teaching, and is a more interactive form of a presentation to keep them engaged | We will put flow charts and images of code relating to conditionals, like IF blocks and IF ELSE blocks, and definitions of what algorithms and selection means | Plan to teach for about 10 minutes on this section | Afterward, have them go through 3 questions relating to this conditionals section, thinking one question could be putting a specific example of an IF statement and having them determine the outcome | Maybe question where you are given a scenario and have to show me how you would build this conditional statement on VSCode | First person to get these questions right can be rewarded with candy | At the end, we could give them independent work time to create an IF statement and and IF ELSE statement in VSCode as homework | .",

            "content": ". Classes I Visited . I visited many classes for the night of the Museum such as 3D Computer Animation, Ceramics, and Photography. The class that this picture is from is Ceramics. This was one of the projects where you had to make a teacup or teapot, and it was up to you to decide what you wanted it to look like. This person decided to incorporate an octopus onto the cup by attaching tentacles all over it. Something I really liked about this project is the texture of the tentacles and how the barnacles look and felt so real. This is another picture from Ceramics. One of the projects was to make whatever you wanted using all the previous projects as inspiration. This person made a plate and a mug that were both M&amp;M themed, and this plate was the orange M&amp;M. I really like the theme that he went with and the execution of the logo. . Ideas for Next Trimester . Our project came out pretty solid, however there was a lot more things that I wanted to add for improvement. I really wanted to add a dropdown menu, but was very hard for me to make and find a tutorial that I found helpful. As the Frontend Developer, I did a decent job at making the website look aesthetically appealing, however I wish I could have done and learned a lot more styles to make everything look better. One big takeaway from this project was to have better time management as a group, because if we split the work up more evenly and throughout more days, our project could have reached a higher potential and outcome. .",

            "content": "Questions that I missed . 6. Loop terminates when count exceeds max, so only values less than or equal to max are printed. . 8. The procedure does not interchange the values of j and k. Rather, it returns a new list with the values at indices j and k interchanged. . 11. Wasn’t too sure on this question and confused. The inner loop iterates from index j + 1 to the end of the list, so each element is only compared with the elements that follow it. . 14. When numCorrect is 9, the condition numCorrect &gt; 7 evaluates to true and the condition numCorrect ≥ 9 evaluates to true. Therefore “check plus” is displayed as intended. . 16. Thought that it was only broken up into two packets but there are many more. Messages are broken into as many packets as are needed to transmit the data. Each packet contains both data and metadata. . 21. Statement I is true because strings of characters can be represented by sequences of bits. . 22. Confused on binary numbers a bit. Binary 0110 is equivalent to 22+21, or decimal 6. . 29. Switched my answers at the very end from the right one to the wrong one. Input data can be stored as any data type. Programming languages do not typically store input data in a list for record-keeping purposes. . 32. The last assignment statement assigns a copy of myList to yourList, rather than appending one list to the other. . 34. The code segment initializes the three lists, and then swaps the contents of firstList and secondList rather than appending one list to the other. . 35. Didn’t know if the MaxPs 50 goes before or after. . 36. This would be the correct solution if i were initialized to 2 instead of 1. This code segment will generate the list [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]. . 37. Confused on what temp means. A temporary variable is needed to interchange the values of two variables. . 39. List indices are typically nonnegative integers, so a decimal number between two integers would be considered an invalid index. . 41. This is the initial value of p. None of the variables has the value 10 after executing the code segment. . 42. After initially assigning values to the variables, the code segment assigns the value 4 to num3 and assigns the value 8 to num1. The value of sum at the end of the code segment is 8 + 4 + 4, or 16. . 43. This is the value of x after the code segment is executed, not the value of result. . 45. The code segment iterates through each element in the list, incrementing count1 for each positive value and incrementing count2 otherwise. There are only two positive values in the list, not five. . 46. The fourth statement assigns the value of second (which is true) to first. . 48. The value of y is initially 50, but its value is changed to 75 in the fifth statement. . 49. Switched answers last second. This code segment produces the string “onno”. . 50. Overall confused on how to attack this question. Took my best guess on this one. .",

Innovations are improved through collaboration in CSP | A computing innovation includes a program as an integral part of its function | Effective collaboration skills: Communication, consensus building, conflict resolution, negotiation | Computing innovation: reflects the diversity of talents and unique perspectives of all the programers who worked to create it | Collaboration on projects can reduce bias since there are various perspectives Video Quiz: Daily Video 2 . | How computing innovations are developed by groups of people | Consultation and communication between peers is important | Information contributed from all the group members can help understand the purpose of the program and create one that incorporates all the perspectives | Online tools can help collaboration such as pair programming | Pair programming: work together in pairs- the driver writes the code, the navigator reviews it | Think pair share: students work through a problem alone then pair with a partner then share with class | It is important to give credit 1.1 Collaboration Quiz . . 1.2 Program Function and Purpose Notes . Daily Video 1 . | It is important to know and be able to describe the purpose of a computing innovation | The purpose could be to solve problems, pursue interests through creative expression, etc. | Truly understanding the purpose of a program helps the developer(s) develop the program better Daily Video 2 . | Identify inputs/outputs to a program | Program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Some forms can be: tactile, audio, visual, text | An event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program | Events can be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse clicked, etc. Can be any defined action that affects the flow of execution | Inputs generally affect the output of a program | In a program, the code is made in a way that after an action, the code “jumps” to the code segment according to the event | Program’s output is based off input or prior state Daily Video 3 . | A program (software) is a collection of program statements the performs a specific task when run by a computer. | A code segment is a collection of program statements that is a part of a program | Software needs to work for a variety of inputs | The behavior is how the program functions during execution and if often described by how a user can interact with it. | Can be described broadly by what it does or in detail on how the program accomplishes its function | A program is a collection of statements: A statement is a single command, a group of statements is a code segment, code segments are executed -&gt; a program/software 1.2 Program Function and Purpose Quiz . . 1.3 Program Design and Development Notes . Daily Video 1 . | Use a development process to develop a program | Design a program and its user interface | A development process can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature | Common phases when developing a program: investigating and reflecting, designing, prototyping, testing | Requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, and reflection: may require revisiting phases | Break the project into smaller pieces and make sure each piece works before adding it to the whole | Investigate to determine requirements, constraints, concerns and interests of customer | Investigate by: collecting data through surveys, user testing, interviews, direct observations | Requirements describe how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program should provide | Design phase that outlines how to accomplish a program’s goal may include: brainstorming, planning/storyboarding, organizing the program into modules and functional components, creation of diagrams, develop testing strategy | Constantly test your program Daily Video 2 . | When developing a program, it is important to cite and acknowledge code segments used from either another source or developed collaboratively | When acknowledging someone else, include the origin of code or authors name in the program documentation | Team of people usually work on a program by each focusing on different functional components | Each member’s work should be credited in program documentation Sometimes credit is given with comments in the code | Many developers use code segments, procedures, algorithms made by others who aren’t part of the project so it is important to credit them Daily Video 3 . | Describe the purpose of a code segment or program by writing documentation | Program documentation: a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program and how it was developed EX: comments (don’t effect how the program runs) | Should actively document throughout development to help development as well as maintaining correct programs | Program documentation created to: describe the program, list specifications, describe different parts of the program, list of contributors | Document process: beginning: list specifications, during: keep track of progress, after: explain overall process | Documentation improves: programming process efficiency, ability to test and refine program, responding to bugs 1.3 Program Design and Development Quiz . . | . Questions I still have with problem sets . I found this question to be the most difficult for me throughout all of 1.1-1.3. After looking over the correct answer and explanation, it makes more sense however is still a little confusing to me. .",

            "content": "What I Learned . I learned a lot of things from this presentation. Laurie Santos enlightened me on the way to live an overall happier life and improve the way I live on a day to day basis. I learned how important it is to take time out of my day to be thankful and grateful for all the things given to me in life. She taught me to really count all the blessings I have in life. After learning this, I’ve started to try taking a minute or two out of my day to write out all the things I am grateful for. Not only did she say studies prove that this increases a better quality of life, but personally, I’m starting to see positive results. Santos also taught me the importance of helping other people. She expressed that people who help others are more happy in life. I’ve also started to help others before helping myself at times, and can really start to see a happier lifestyle panning out. . What My Partner Learned . My partner Saavan took away a ton of concepts as well. One thing Saavan took from Santos was that helping others help us more than we expect. He can relate to this because he noticed that the more he starts helping and giving to others, the happier his life becomes. Another thing he took away was writing a letter of gratitude to someone. He noticed that people that receive this letter will actually appreciate it more than you will ever know. Giving a letter of gratitude to someone spreads the happiness they bring you to them, which will reciprocate it back. . What My Group Took Away . Derek’s Thoughts: What I found interesting about the video is that everyone deals with stress, and it is not something easy to just deal with. One thing that Laurie Santos was that 40% of the students from her class in Yale said they feel helpless. This really struck me because it puts into perspective how many people deal with some sort of unhappiness and that we are not alone. . Rohan’s Thoughts: It was relatable, she mentioned good strategies to reduce stress. The statistics that she said were also very alarming to me. I also believe that stress hinders the ability to learn. . Dillon’s Thoughts: I found it very surprising how much anxiety and stress the average college student has during their time spent in academic environment. It makes me worry about myself and how college life will be like. I also reflect and think about how much correlation it has with high school stress at Del Norte. . Saavan’s Thoughts: I thought it was good to know the things we need to do to relieve stress. I believe that it is very important in working towards living a happier life, and its not as easy as it sounds. . Note of Gratitude to My Brother . I wanted to write a note of gratitude to my brother. I just wanted to thank him for listening to personal stuff I can only talk to him about, and helping me better myself in ways. I’m thankful that he takes the time out of his busy day to go to the gym with me if I ask. I also am thankful that he understands and tells me what I need to work on so that I can better myself academically and in my personal growth. . Gratitude List . Things Im Grateful for: . my parents | my brother | my friends | house | food | water | clothes | my dog | .",

            "content": "Applab Planning/Blogging . Outline of Quiz . For our outline, Saavan and I wanted to create a quiz revolved around NBA. So we planned out 3 NBA questions that we wanted to use, and started planning out how we want the site to look. We wanted a home screen to introduce the quiz with a start button, 3 separate screens for each question, 2 other screens for if you get the question wrong or right, and a final screen to address that you have won and the results. . Successes . This is me breaking down the success of figuring out how to code a button so that it switches to a new screen. . 1. Program Purpose and Function . The purpose of this program is so that the when the button is clicked, it switches the current screen to a new one. The input of this program is the onEvent, where if the start button is clicked, then it will do the function of the set screen, which is the output of screen2, which will change the current screen to that. . 2. Data Abstraction . The name of the variable is start_button. It is representing what needs to be “clicked”, in order for the input to work. . Discoveries . One discovery that I found was how to code a button so that it switches to a new screen. Another discovery I found was how to work a dropdown so that if it clicks on certain options it sets the screen to that option. . Challenges . There were a ton of problems that we encountered once we started creating our site. Some minor problems was figuring out how to code a button so that it goes to the next screen, how to code an image so that if it is clicked it goes to the next screen, etc. But once we figured out the code to that, if was very satisfying and much easier to create our App. However one idea that we came up with was making it so that if they get the question wrong or right, it takes them to a screen telling them that, and then a button to make them proceed or go back. This was a slight problem because we realized that we can’t just have one screen for wrong or right, but have that for each question, since the buttons would have to take you back or move you forward at different questions. . . This picture displays the 6 different screens we had to make, since we had to make a correct and wrong screen for each question, which would rather bring them back to the same question if they got it wrong, or proceed to the next question if they get it right, or the results if they get the final question right. .",

            "content": "Idea on Project . An idea I had for this project is somehow creating a website with a whole bunch of movies and TV shows that you can choose from, and a way to search for all of them. The technical requirements for this project include: . Final program code (created independently or collaboratively) | A video that displays the running of your program and demonstrates functionality you developed (created independently) | Written responses to all the prompts in the performance task (created independently) | . I feel like the things I can design now are probably the dropdown menu to choose from all these movies, and the code for when they click on the movie, for it to take them to a different screen to watch it. It also says &quot;students need practice implementing programs that first include sequencing, then incorporate selection and iteration, and finally use procedures and lists.&quot; I feel that we&#39;ve touched most if not all of these basics over the first couple of weeks. Somethings I would still need to learn is how to put the actual movie or TV show on the site, so when they hit play, they are watching it on the site. Some resources that I have available is code.org to maybe help we work with building apps more and understanding the code, the people around me in this class, and past students that have already taken this class. . from IPython.display import Image Image(filename=&quot;/Users/dmsol/Tera/images/Screen Shot 2022-09-11 at 12.29.24 PM.png&quot;, width=600, height=400) .",

            "content": "8/18/22 . Forms of Government Notes: . Autocracy . One person has all the power . | Two main types: monarchy/dictatorship . | . Monarchy . king/queen rules the country . | King or queen is known as the monarch . | Come to power through family line, current kings/queens oldest child becomes next queen/king . | Olden times, Have final say over government . | Modern times, share power with other parts of government . | . Dictatorship . One leader with absolute control over the people . | Has control over things, like a constitution . | Parts of government do what the dictator wants . | . Democracy . Citizens hold power . | Two types of democracies: representative/direct . | . Representative democracy . The people elect leaders to represent them in government . | They do all the necessary things to keep the country running . | Citizens hold ultimate power, if they don’t like what their representatives do, they can vote new representatives . | . Direct democracy . No representative, people directly involved in governing the country . | Might be required to participate in lawmaking or judges . | Most modern countries too large for direct democracy to work . | . Oligarchy(oligarchy- rule by a few) . Small group of people hold all the power . | Only certain group has political rights . | Few people control the country . | Junta - small group of people (usually military officers) who rule a country after taking it by force . | Junta operates kind of like a dictatorship . | . Theocracy(theo = God) . Government that puts God or a divine being as the ultimate authority . | Religious law settles . | . 8/19/22 . Public Policy . The goals and programs our government creates and implements for society (to create order and take care of people) . | Complicated process - involves various stakes and “inputs” . | Inputs: voters, media, special interest groups(organization that are non-governmental), politicians . | . Role of Government . What should the government do? (National, state and local) . | National government - government of the U.S., federal government . | State government - governor, make a lot of rules/regulations for California, whether constitution does not discuss is left to the states . | Local government - mayor, city council, school board . | Answers varu. Ideas differ. . | We do agree on some basic things! . | . Limited government . | Rule of law . | Social contract . | Democracy . | . Tonight’s Reading Notes: Liberal &amp; Conservatives . DQ: What are some examples in which libertarians would like the government to take minimal take action? . The Ideas that Divide Us . Most Americans are united through key values (democracy, freedom, and equality) . | We are dramatically different; regilionm education geographically, and backgrounds . | This creates different opinions politically and can divide us . | . Ideologies - different belief systems . Our ideologies depend on the arguments we make to back them up . | Our debate is narrow in the U.S. compared to other countries . | No communist or socialist parties in the U.S. . | Two main ideological camps, liberals(Democratic Party) and conservatives(Republicans) . | Conservatives form a political opinon from traditional social values, distrust of government action, resistance to change, and social order . | Liberals form a political opinon from potential for progress and change, trust in government, innovations to answer societies problems, and expansion of individual rights/expression . | . The Economic Dimension . Since FDR and Great Depression, conservatives and liberals differ on how much they should trust the government . | Conservatives = not trust gov with too much power . | Liberals = willing to trust gov more to regulate economy . | Conservatives = right . | Liberals = left . | . The Social Order Dimension . People divided on how much of the government’s role should partake in controlling their lives . | Conservatives view of social order = emphasize religion in public life, no abortion/suicide, promote traditional family values(no gay marriage/rights), “American Way”(no diversity/restricting immigration), people should know their place in society, block anything that promotes the opposite of this . | Liberals view of social order = preserve environment, community of equality/protect minorites, individual safety(gun control laws) . | . The Relationship Between the Two Ideological Dimensions . Economic liberals - willing to let government make decisions about the economy and like individualistic positions in social order . Favor housing subsidies for the poor . | Taxing to support social programs . | Affirmative action . | Prefer individuals to have full freedom on noneconomic terms . | Value diversity/expanding rights to those who were left out . | . Economic conservatives - dont want government to interfere with peoples private lives and that gov should limit their role in economy too . Lessen role of decision making to relugate the market . | Eliminate unfair trade practices . | Provision of some public goods . | Open policies to immigrants . | . Libertarians - extreme holders of economic conservative views, believe that only minimal government action is necessary . Social liberals - like some government role to achieve more equal distribution of material resources and want some role in social order too . Like freedom to make individual moral choices . | Want government action for diverse and equal power structure and regulate to better health and safety . | . Communitarians - extreme of social liberalisms, strong commitment to community by equality of all people . Social conservatives - want limited government involvement economically but less forcefully than conservatives . Concern of moral life . | Emphasize funadmentalist religious values and traditional family roles(gov control of reproductive choices) . | Reject change or diversity . | Immigration is a threat, dilutes social order . | Protect moral character, like a community thatemphasizes hierarchical order over equality . | Like a large/powerful state . | . Class Discussion: . Ideologies - set of beliefs about politics and society that help us make sense of the world(parents most influence this) . U.S - 2 primary ideological camps . . Most Americans are somewhere in the middle of the political spectrum and are not extreme in their views(called moderates) . | Republican and Democrat are NOT ideologies, they are parties…it’s different! . | Many conservative and liberal political parties. R’s/D’s are just the two biggest ones in US poltiics . | . Liberals - Democrats, Green Party . Conservatives Republicans, Reform Party . Libertarians - conservative, consistent about little government intervention . 1930’s Key time period - Great Depression . -New ideas on government intervention(more of it) - more liberal . Polarization . -means being farther apart in views . -L and C are MORE polarized in recent years . Why? Lots of theories: media, social media, weak parties, a primary system with low voter turnout(mostly those more extreme), little incentive for one party to “help” the other party govern after an election . -Polarization makes compromise harder . . 8/23/22 Notes . -Vouchers . -Public education is paid for by taxpayer dollars, mostly by state taxes . -some fed gov money, but constitution says nothing about education, thats why states mainly pay for it . 8/23/22 . Media Lecture Notes . Types of Media . Print - it is hardcopy, like newspapers . Less readers of Print media . | Influential, don’t want to see newspapers die out . | More politically active . | MORE reporting . | Ex: NYT, LA Times, WAPO . | . Broadcast Media - news from the TV or radio . Where most people get there news . | Ex: ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, etc. . | Talk radio - radio host where people come on and you interview them, not scripted, very partisan . | Internet - changed media and a lot more people need it . | Mix of sites, a lot are inaccurate . | . How Media Works . Profit, most driven by this . | They get it from advertising . | Conglomerates . | Can watch two different news station and they could actually both be owned by Disney, so should look at a variety of stations . | Professional Code of Ethics - Truthful, accuracy, etc. . | Correct themselves . | Reliable sources . | . Source Types . “On-the-record” - can be quoted, nothing has to be hidden, can use name and everything . | “On background” - dont use my name, but you can quote me, you can also give some hint as to where I work . | “On deep background” - take away more information, source is more deeply hidden, no quote directy but paraphrase allowed, can’t name person or where they work . | “Off the record” - nothing can be used, no information can come out, basically research for the reporter . | . Roles of the Media . Gatekeeper - the media can control and determine what and how long something can become a national political issue, they determine whats important to us and whats not . | Watchdog - Responsible of keeping track what the government does that might be wrong (Ex: Watergate scandal) . | Score Keeper - candidate does something or says something that is not great or good, makes politicians more careful with what they do . | Agenda Setter - similar to gatekeeper, helping the public decide what is important, whether public think is important is what the government is going to address . | . 8/24/22 . Fake News . Intential false information published as a fact . | NOT satire . | NOT an unintentional mistake . | NOT true information that you disagree with . | NOT editorial . | . How to Tell If it’s Fake News . Look at the URL - .co, .lo, .com. . | Check the “About Us” section . | Is there an address, location, staff? . | Who is the author? Do they have some credibility, Reporter? . | Check news on a factcheck site, factcheck.org or snopes.com . | Avoid provocative headlines . | Are there ridiculous statements? . | Avoid headlines or stories that use ALL CAPS . | Clickbait = “X reasons why…” . | . How to tell if it’s fake news or satire . If it sounds like a joke . | . Conspiracy theories .
