            "content": "Applab Planning/Blogging . Outline of Quiz . For our outline, Saavan and I wanted to create a quiz revolved around NBA. So we planned out 3 NBA questions that we wanted to use, and started planning out how we want the site to look. We wanted a home screen to introduce the quiz with a start button, 3 separate screens for each question, 2 other screens for if you get the question wrong or right, and a final screen to address that you have won and the results. . Successes . This is me breaking down the success of figuring out how to code a button so that it switches to a new screen. . 1. Program Purpose and Function . The purpose of this program is so that the when the button is clicked, it switches the current screen to a new one. The input of this program is the onEvent, where if the start button is clicked, then it will do the function of the set screen, which is the output of screen2, which will change the current screen to that. . 2. Data Abstraction . The name of the variable is start_button. It is representing what needs to be “clicked”, in order for the input to work. . Discoveries . One discovery that I found was how to code a button so that it switches to a new screen. Another discovery I found was how to work a dropdown so that if it clicks on certain options it sets the screen to that option . Challenges . There were a ton of problems that we encountered once we started creating our site. Some minor problems was figuring out how to code a button so that it goes to the next screen, how to code an image so that if it is clicked it goes to the next screen, etc. But once we figured out the code to that, if was very satisfying and much easier to create our App. However one idea that we came up with was making it so that if they get the question wrong or right, it takes them to a screen telling them that, and then a button to make them proceed or go back. This was a slight problem because we realized that we can’t just have one screen for wrong or right, but have that for each question, since the buttons would have to take you back or move you forward at different questions. . . This picture displays the 6 different screens we had to make, since we had to make a correct and wrong screen for each question, which would rather bring them back to the same question if they got it wrong, or proceed to the next question if they get it right, or the results if they get the final question right. .",

            "content": "8/18/22 . Forms of Government Notes: . Autocracy . One person has all the power . | Two main types: monarchy/dictatorship . | . Monarchy . king/queen rules the country . | King or queen is known as the monarch . | Come to power through family line, current kings/queens oldest child becomes next queen/king . | Olden times, Have final say over government . | Modern times, share power with other parts of government . | . Dictatorship . One leader with absolute control over the people . | Has control over things, like a constitution . | Parts of government do what the dictator wants . | . Democracy . Citizens hold power . | Two types of democracies: representative/direct . | . Representative democracy . The people elect leaders to represent them in government . | They do all the necessary things to keep the country running . | Citizens hold ultimate power, if they don’t like what their representatives do, they can vote new representatives . | . Direct democracy . No representative, people directly involved in governing the country . | Might be required to participate in lawmaking or judges . | Most modern countries too large for direct democracy to work . | . Oligarchy(oligarchy- rule by a few) . Small group of people hold all the power . | Only certain group has political rights . | Few people control the country . | Junta - small group of people (usually military officers) who rule a country after taking it by force . | Junta operates kind of like a dictatorship . | . Theocracy(theo = God) . Government that puts God or a divine being as the ultimate authority . | Religious law settles . | . 8/19/22 . Public Policy . The goals and programs our government creates and implements for society (to create order and take care of people) . | Complicated process - involves various stakes and “inputs” . | Inputs: voters, media, special interest groups(organization that are non-governmental), politicians . | . Role of Government . What should the government do? (National, state and local) . | National government - government of the U.S., federal government . | State government - governor, make a lot of rules/regulations for California, whether constitution does not discuss is left to the states . | Local government - mayor, city council, school board . | Answers varu. Ideas differ. . | We do agree on some basic things! . | . Limited government . | Rule of law . | Social contract . | Democracy . | . Tonight’s Reading Notes: Liberal &amp; Conservatives . DQ: What are some examples in which libertarians would like the government to take minimal take action? . The Ideas that Divide Us . Most Americans are united through key values (democracy, freedom, and equality) . | We are dramatically different; regilionm education geographically, and backgrounds . | This creates different opinions politically and can divide us . | . Ideologies - different belief systems . Our ideologies depend on the arguments we make to back them up . | Our debate is narrow in the U.S. compared to other countries . | No communist or socialist parties in the U.S. . | Two main ideological camps, liberals(Democratic Party) and conservatives(Republicans) . | Conservatives form a political opinon from traditional social values, distrust of government action, resistance to change, and social order . | Liberals form a political opinon from potential for progress and change, trust in government, innovations to answer societies problems, and expansion of individual rights/expression . | . The Economic Dimension . Since FDR and Great Depression, conservatives and liberals differ on how much they should trust the government . | Conservatives = not trust gov with too much power . | Liberals = willing to trust gov more to regulate economy . | Conservatives = right . | Liberals = left . | . The Social Order Dimension . People divided on how much of the government’s role should partake in controlling their lives . | Conservatives view of social order = emphasize religion in public life, no abortion/suicide, promote traditional family values(no gay marriage/rights), “American Way”(no diversity/restricting immigration), people should know their place in society, block anything that promotes the opposite of this . | Liberals view of social order = preserve environment, community of equality/protect minorites, individual safety(gun control laws) . | . The Relationship Between the Two Ideological Dimensions . Economic liberals - willing to let government make decisions about the economy and like individualistic positions in social order . Favor housing subsidies for the poor . | Taxing to support social programs . | Affirmative action . | Prefer individuals to have full freedom on noneconomic terms . | Value diversity/expanding rights to those who were left out . | . Economic conservatives - dont want government to interfere with peoples private lives and that gov should limit their role in economy too . Lessen role of decision making to relugate the market . | Eliminate unfair trade practices . | Provision of some public goods . | Open policies to immigrants . | . Libertarians - extreme holders of economic conservative views, believe that only minimal government action is necessary . Social liberals - like some government role to achieve more equal distribution of material resources and want some role in social order too . Like freedom to make individual moral choices . | Want government action for diverse and equal power structure and regulate to better health and safety . | . Communitarians - extreme of social liberalisms, strong commitment to community by equality of all people . Social conservatives - want limited government involvement economically but less forcefully than conservatives . Concern of moral life . | Emphasize funadmentalist religious values and traditional family roles(gov control of reproductive choices) . | Reject change or diversity . | Immigration is a threat, dilutes social order . | Protect moral character, like a community thatemphasizes hierarchical order over equality . | Like a large/powerful state . | . Class Discussion: . Ideologies - set of beliefs about politics and society that help us make sense of the world(parents most influence this) . U.S - 2 primary ideological camps . . Most Americans are somewhere in the middle of the political spectrum and are not extreme in their views(called moderates) . | Republican and Democrat are NOT ideologies, they are parties…it’s different! . | Many conservative and liberal political parties. R’s/D’s are just the two biggest ones in US poltiics . | . Liberals - Democrats, Green Party . Conservatives Republicans, Reform Party . Libertarians - conservative, consistent about little government intervention . 1930’s Key time period - Great Depression . -New ideas on government intervention(more of it) - more liberal . Polarization . -means being farther apart in views . -L and C are MORE polarized in recent years . Why? Lots of theories: media, social media, weak parties, a primary system with low voter turnout(mostly those more extreme), little incentive for one party to “help” the other party govern after an election . -Polarization makes compromise harder . . 8/23/22 Notes . -Vouchers . -Public education is paid for by taxpayer dollars, mostly by state taxes . -some fed gov money, but constitution says nothing about education, thats why states mainly pay for it . 8/23/22 . Media Lecture Notes . Types of Media . Print - it is hardcopy, like newspapers . Less readers of Print media . | Influential, don’t want to see newspapers die out . | More politically active . | MORE reporting . | Ex: NYT, LA Times, WAPO . | . Broadcast Media - news from the TV or radio . Where most people get there news . | Ex: ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, etc. . | Talk radio - radio host where people come on and you interview them, not scripted, very partisan . | Internet - changed media and a lot more people need it . | Mix of sites, a lot are inaccurate . | . How Media Works . Profit, most driven by this . | They get it from advertising . | Conglomerates . | Can watch two different news station and they could actually both be owned by Disney, so should look at a variety of stations . | Professional Code of Ethics - Truthful, accuracy, etc. . | Correct themselves . | Reliable sources . | . Source Types . “On-the-record” - can be quoted, nothing has to be hidden, can use name and everything . | “On background” - dont use my name, but you can quote me, you can also give some hint as to where I work . | “On deep background” - take away more information, source is more deeply hidden, no quote directy but paraphrase allowed, can’t name person or where they work . | “Off the record” - nothing can be used, no information can come out, basically research for the reporter . | . Roles of the Media . Gatekeeper - the media can control and determine what and how long something can become a national political issue, they determine whats important to us and whats not . | Watchdog - Responsible of keeping track what the government does that might be wrong (Ex: Watergate scandal) . | Score Keeper - candidate does something or says something that is not great or good, makes politicians more careful with what they do . | Agenda Setter - similar to gatekeeper, helping the public decide what is important, whether public think is important is what the government is going to address . | . 8/24/22 . Fake News . Intential false information published as a fact . | NOT satire . | NOT an unintentional mistake . | NOT true information that you disagree with . | NOT editorial . | . How to Tell If it’s Fake News . Look at the URL - .co, .lo, .com. . | Check the “About Us” section . | Is there an address, location, staff? . | Who is the author? Do they have some credibility, Reporter? . | Check news on a factcheck site, factcheck.org or snopes.com . | Avoid provocative headlines . | Are there ridiculous statements? . | Avoid headlines or stories that use ALL CAPS . | Clickbait = “X reasons why…” . | . How to tell if it’s fake news or satire . If it sounds like a joke . | . Conspiracy theories . Conspiracy sources published unverified information that relates to known conspiracies (Aliens, Illuminati, etc.) . | Psuedoscience is similar, punlishes unverified health and scientific claim . | . Confirmation Bias . Confirmation bias leads you to believe information just because you happen to agree with and discount the parts you don’t . | Just because you think i’ts true doesn’t make it true . | If your goal is to find the truth - you need to use critical thinking skills to evaluate the validity of information . | . 8/26/22 .
