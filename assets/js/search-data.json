            "content": "8/18/22 . Forms of Government Notes: . Autocracy . One person has all the power . | Two main types: monarchy/dictatorship . | . Monarchy . king/queen rules the country . | King or queen is known as the monarch . | Come to power through family line, current kings/queens oldest child becomes next queen/king . | Olden times, Have final say over government . | Modern times, share power with other parts of government . | . Dictatorship . One leader with absolute control over the people . | Has control over things, like a constitution . | Parts of government do what the dictator wants . | . Democracy . Citizens hold power . | Two types of democracies: representative/direct . | . Representative democracy . The people elect leaders to represent them in government . | They do all the necessary things to keep the country running . | Citizens hold ultimate power, if they don’t like what their representatives do, they can vote new representatives . | . Direct democracy . No representative, people directly involved in governing the country . | Might be required to participate in lawmaking or judges . | Most modern countries too large for direct democracy to work . | . Oligarchy(oligarchy- rule by a few) . Small group of people hold all the power . | Only certain group has political rights . | Few people control the country . | Junta - small group of people (usually military officers) who rule a country after taking it by force . | Junta operates kind of like a dictatorship . | . Theocracy(theo = God) . Government that puts God or a divine being as the ultimate authority . | Religious law settles . | . 8/19/22 . Public Policy . The goals and programs our government creates and implements for society (to create order and take care of people) . | Complicated process - involves various stakes and “inputs” . | Inputs: voters, media, special interest groups(organization that are non-governmental), politicians . | . Role of Government . What should the government do? (National, state and local) . | National government - government of the U.S., federal government . | State government - governor, make a lot of rules/regulations for California, whether constitution does not discuss is left to the states . | Local government - mayor, city council, school board . | Answers varu. Ideas differ. . | We do agree on some basic things! . | . Limited government . | Rule of law . | Social contract . | Democracy . | . Tonight’s Reading Notes: Liberal &amp; Conservatives . DQ: What are some examples in which libertarians would like the government to take minimal take action? . The Ideas that Divide Us . Most Americans are united through key values (democracy, freedom, and equality) . | We are dramatically different; regilionm education geographically, and backgrounds . | This creates different opinions politically and can divide us . | . Ideologies - different belief systems . Our ideologies depend on the arguments we make to back them up . | Our debate is narrow in the U.S. compared to other countries . | No communist or socialist parties in the U.S. . | Two main ideological camps, liberals(Democratic Party) and conservatives(Republicans) . | Conservatives form a political opinon from traditional social values, distrust of government action, resistance to change, and social order . | Liberals form a political opinon from potential for progress and change, trust in government, innovations to answer societies problems, and expansion of individual rights/expression . | . The Economic Dimension . Since FDR and Great Depression, conservatives and liberals differ on how much they should trust the government . | Conservatives = not trust gov with too much power . | Liberals = willing to trust gov more to regulate economy . | Conservatives = right . | Liberals = left . | . The Social Order Dimension . People divided on how much of the government’s role should partake in controlling their lives . | Conservatives view of social order = emphasize religion in public life, no abortion/suicide, promote traditional family values(no gay marriage/rights), “American Way”(no diversity/restricting immigration), people should know their place in society, block anything that promotes the opposite of this . | Liberals view of social order = preserve environment, community of equality/protect minorites, individual safety(gun control laws) . | . The Relationship Between the Two Ideological Dimensions . Economic liberals - willing to let government make decisions about the economy and like individualistic positions in social order . Favor housing subsidies for the poor . | Taxing to support social programs . | Affirmative action . | Prefer individuals to have full freedom on noneconomic terms . | Value diversity/expanding rights to those who were left out . | . Economic conservatives - dont want government to interfere with peoples private lives and that gov should limit their role in economy too . Lessen role of decision making to relugate the market . | Eliminate unfair trade practices . | Provision of some public goods . | Open policies to immigrants . | . Libertarians - extreme holders of economic conservative views, believe that only minimal government action is necessary . Social liberals - like some government role to achieve more equal distribution of material resources and want some role in social order too . Like freedom to make individual moral choices . | Want government action for diverse and equal power structure and regulate to better health and safety . | . Communitarians - extreme of social liberalisms, strong commitment to community by equality of all people . Social conservatives - want limited government involvement economically but less forcefully than conservatives . Concern of moral life . | Emphasize funadmentalist religious values and traditional family roles(gov control of reproductive choices) . | Reject change or diversity . | Immigration is a threat, dilutes social order . | Protect moral character, like a community thatemphasizes hierarchical order over equality . | Like a large/powerful state . | . Class Discussion: . Ideologies - set of beliefs about politics and society that help us make sense of the world(parents most influence this) . U.S - 2 primary ideological camps . . Most Americans are somewhere in the middle of the political spectrum and are not extreme in their views(called moderates) . | Republican and Democrat are NOT ideologies, they are parties…it’s different! . | Many conservative and liberal political parties. R’s/D’s are just the two biggest ones in US poltiics . | . Liberals - Democrats, Green Party . Conservatives Republicans, Reform Party . Libertarians - conservative, consistent about little government intervention . 1930’s Key time period - Great Depression . -New ideas on government intervention(more of it) - more liberal . Polarization . -means being farther apart in views . -L and C are MORE polarized in recent years . Why? Lots of theories: media, social media, weak parties, a primary system with low voter turnout(mostly those more extreme), little incentive for one party to “help” the other party govern after an election . -Polarization makes compromise harder . . 8/23/22 Notes . -Vouchers . -Public education is paid for by taxpayer dollars, mostly by state taxes . -some fed gov money, but constitution says nothing about education, thats why states mainly pay for it . 8/23/22 . Media Lecture Notes . Types of Media . Print - it is hardcopy, like newspapers . Less readers of Print media . | Influential, don’t want to see newspapers die out . | More politically active . | MORE reporting . | Ex: NYT, LA Times, WAPO . | . Broadcast Media - news from the TV or radio . Where most people get there news . | Ex: ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, etc. . | Talk radio - radio host where people come on and you interview them, not scripted, very partisan . | Internet - changed media and a lot more people need it . | Mix of sites, a lot are inaccurate . | . How Media Works . Profit, most driven by this . | They get it from advertising . | Conglomerates . | Can watch two different news station and they could actually both be owned by Disney, so should look at a variety of stations . | Professional Code of Ethics - Truthful, accuracy, etc. . | Correct themselves . | Reliable sources . | . Source Types . “On-the-record” - can be quoted, nothing has to be hidden, can use name and everything . | “On background” - dont use my name, but you can quote me, you can also give some hint as to where I work . | “On deep background” - take away more information, source is more deeply hidden, no quote directy but paraphrase allowed, can’t name person or where they work . | “Off the record” - nothing can be used, no information can come out, basically research for the reporter . | . Roles of the Media . Gatekeeper - the media can control and determine what and how long something can become a national political issue, they determine whats important to us and whats not . | Watchdog - Responsible of keeping track what the government does that might be wrong (Ex: Watergate scandal) . | Score Keeper - candidate does something or says something that is not great or good, makes politicians more careful with what they do . | Agenda Setter - similar to gatekeeper, helping the public decide what is important, whether public think is important is what the government is going to address . | . 8/24/22 . Fake News . Intential false information published as a fact . | NOT satire . | NOT an unintentional mistake . | NOT true information that you disagree with . | NOT editorial . | . How to Tell If it’s Fake News . Look at the URL - .co, .lo, .com. . | Check the “About Us” section . | Is there an address, location, staff? . | Who is the author? Do they have some credibility, Reporter? . | Check news on a factcheck site, factcheck.org or snopes.com . | Avoid provocative headlines . | Are there ridiculous statements? . | Avoid headlines or stories that use ALL CAPS . | Clickbait = “X reasons why…” . | . How to tell if it’s fake news or satire . If it sounds like a joke . | . Conspiracy theories . Conspiracy sources published unverified information that relates to known conspiracies (Aliens, Illuminati, etc.) . | Psuedoscience is similar, punlishes unverified health and scientific claim . | . Confirmation Bias . Confirmation bias leads you to believe information just because you happen to agree with and discount the parts you don’t . | Just because you think i’ts true doesn’t make it true . | If your goal is to find the truth - you need to use critical thinking skills to evaluate the validity of information . | . 8/26/22 .

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
