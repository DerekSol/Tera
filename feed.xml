The class that this picture is from is Ceramics. This was one of the projects where you had to make a teacup or teapot, and it was up to you to decide what you wanted it to look like. This person decided to incorporate an octopus onto the cup by attaching tentacles all over it. Something I really liked about this project is the texture of the tentacles and how the barnacles look and felt so real. This is another picture from Ceramics. One of the projects was to make whatever you wanted using all the previous projects as inspiration. This person made a plate and a mug that were both M&amp;M themed, and this plate was the orange M&amp;M. I really like the theme that he went with and the execution of the logo. Ideas for Next Trimester Our project came out pretty solid, however there was a lot more things that I wanted to add for improvement. I really wanted to add a dropdown menu, but was very hard for me to make and find a tutorial that I found helpful. As the Frontend Developer, I did a decent job at making the website look aesthetically appealing, however I wish I could have done and learned a lot more styles to make everything look better. One big takeaway from this project was to have better time management as a group, because if we split the work up more evenly and throughout more days, our project could have reached a higher potential and outcome.]]></summary></entry></feed>
